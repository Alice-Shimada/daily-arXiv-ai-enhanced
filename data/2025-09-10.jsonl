One key argument to help differentiate an\nSMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB\nsourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a\ncosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially\nlarge-scale structure.

In regions of extreme gravity near\nsingularities, it becomes a non-perturbative, space-time--dependent field that\ncreates new space-time domains beyond gravitational singularities -- new\nregions governed by antigravity. This mechanism produces dramatic dynamics\ninside black holes and in the earliest universe, including restoration of the\nelectroweak symmetry SU(2)xU(1) at singularities. The adjoining gravity and\nantigravity regions form a geodesically complete space-time bridged by\ntraversable singularities -- absent in the Standard Model coupled to general\nrelativity or its extensions such as string theory.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials."}

While\nour theory predicts a \"characteristic\" density for star formation, it also\npredicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed\nsample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given\ndensity bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing\nquasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time\nthroughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column\ndensity and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably\naccurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore\nthe freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column\ndensity plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate\ndensities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to\ndecrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our\nsimulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find\nthis is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and\nembedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is\nsignificantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the\nrelative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several\npossible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly\nconstant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the\nsky plane, resembling observed \"coherent cores.\" We show that this \"coherence\"\nis a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law\nvelocity structure function.

We propose a new quantity,\nnamed the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between\nthe biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit\ndependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example,\nwe further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the\ndetectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location\ngenerally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only\nwhen the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a\npopulation-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly\nhalf of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared\nto a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in\na detector network."}

Template maps of contaminants are used to derive\nspatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the\napplicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability.\nThe complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint\nconservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation.\nWe present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint,\nintegrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that\ndegrade mitigation performance.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials."}

We present analysis of\nBalmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars\n(FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width,\nand apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar\nspectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into\naccount, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated\ncorrelation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this\nsample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds\ncharacterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b),\nobjects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al.\n2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density\nwith respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and\nEddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in\nthe lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with\n{\\alpha}oi, the F{\\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns.\nThis parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among\nlow-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have\nbeen recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of\nhigh-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities\nbetween LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of\nsteep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission,\nand X-ray weakness."}

Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using\nonly a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and\nenvironment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on\nsuper-Hubble modes of {\\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in\nH/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being\nsuper-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for\nsuper-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the\n`rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be\ninapprorpriate for cosmology.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials."}

The time-dependent Dirac equation is solved in the\nrotating frame using the generalized pseudospectral method in modified prolate\nspheroidal coordinates.

Angle-integrated and angle-resolved energy spectra of the\nemitted positrons are calculated by projecting the propagated wave function\nonto positive-energy plane-wave states. Our results show that the magnetic\ninteraction leads to a slight increase in the critical internuclear distance\nand enhances the total positron yield by up to several percent. However, it\ndoes not qualitatively alter the energy or angular distributions of emitted\npositrons. The angular distributions remain nearly isotropic.

For the first time, we analyze this data to search for\nsignatures of heavy decaying and annihilating dark matter in the mass range\n$10^{5}-10^{11}$ GeV. We compute the expected photon flux from both Galactic\nand extragalactic dark matter, incorporating attenuation due to photon pair\nproduction. For the Galactic contribution, we include both prompt photons and\nsecondary photons produced via inverse Compton scattering, accounting for\nelectron/positron propagation. For the extragalactic component, in addition to\nthe prompt and inverse Compton contributions, we also include cascade photons\narising from inverse Compton scattering of pair-produced electrons and\npositrons. By combining all these contributions, we derive constraints on the\ndark matter parameter space. Our bounds for various two body Standard Model\nfinal states are strongest to date.

Since gravity provides the\nweakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of\nprimordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using\nonly a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and\nenvironment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on\nsuper-Hubble modes of {\\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in\nH/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being\nsuper-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for\nsuper-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the\n`rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be\ninapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from\nthe nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We\nidentify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part\nof the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate\nthat grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\\it faster} than found\nearlier.
