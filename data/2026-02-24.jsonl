Extending recent work on static systems, we define the holographic pressure and volume via the trace of the Brown-York stress tensor on the cutoff surface. We demonstrate that the inclusion of angular momentum introduces a momentum flux term at the boundary, requiring a generalized first law: $dE = T_{\\mathrm{loc}}dS + Ω_{\\mathrm{loc}}dJ - \\mathcal{P}d\\mathcal{A}$. We derive the explicit expressions for these thermodynamic conjugates and analyze the equation of state. Crucially, we examine the extensivity of the system in the large-size limit. We find that while small rotating black holes exhibit non-extensive behavior typical of self-gravitating systems, large Kerr-AdS black holes recover extensivity, behaving effectively as a thermal fluid on the boundary. This result strengthens the holographic interpretation of the cutoff surface as the domain of a dual field theory."}

We examine how measured brightnesses depend on time since ACS installation, source location on the WFC detectors, source brightness, and local background level in individual exposures. We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure. However, brightness measurements on smaller scales can suffer deficiencies in excess of 0.1 mags (sometimes, significantly more) in recent data unless sources are very close to the CCD serial registers ($\\lesssim 512$ pixels), or brighter than $\\sim3000\\,e^-$ in a single exposure. We also show how degraded CTE can result in artificial asymmetries in galaxy light distributions, which are largely mitigated if backgrounds are $>20e^-/{pixel}$ and targets are not far ($>1536$ pixels) from the serial registers. As expected, brightness measurements in later epoch data are best when using CTE-corrected images (FLC/DRC), but our results imply that the pixel-based CTE correction algorithm employed by the ACS reduction pipeline does not necessarily place charge back into its original location within extended sources. Based on this study, users are advised to keep backgrounds above the already recommended $30e^-/\\mathrm{pixel}$, ensure targets will have at least $\\sim 300e^-$ in a single exposure, and place targets close to the serial registers if analysis of their spatially resolved properties is needed."}

The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\\%$ ($20\\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\\%$ limits $M_ν<0.073\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_ν<0.090\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ in $Λ$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively.

Imposing theoretical consistency, Higgs invisible-decay limits, and the latest LZ spin-independent bound with the standard relic-fraction rescaling, we show that the severe exclusions typical of thermal two-WIMP analyses are largely an artefact of requiring both components to thermalise with the SM bath. Mixed WIMP-FIMP (and fully feeble FIMP-FIMP) histories reopen regions excluded in thermal two-WIMP interpretations, since the total relic density can be shared while the direct-detection signal is carried only by the thermal fraction. For the unstable hierarchy $M_{S_B}>2M_{S_A}$, we identify decay-dominated regimes-SuperWIMP, injection-assisted freeze-out, and sequential freeze-in (``SuperFIMP'')-where late dark-sector injection sets the final $S_A$ abundance.

We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity."}

Our numerical results demonstrate that the nonlinear parameter $b$ significantly modifies the critical temperature $T_c$ for all states. We focus on the phase structure near the critical pressure $P_c$ and discuss the ``triplet'' phenomenon of these states. The competition between nonlinear effects and geometrical deformation of the black hole induced by pressure is analyzed in detail. Specifically, we find that when the pressure $P$ exceeds the critical pressure $P_c$, both the ground state and the first excited state are superconducting (gapped), while the second excited state is a gapless superconductor. However, at pressures below or equal to $P_c$, while the ground state remains a gapped superconductor, the excited states undergo condensation into gapless phases without exhibiting superconducting gap behavior.

M. Scaife"], "title": "Variational views for self-supervised learning in radio astronomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $β$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($β= 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $β$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $β$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys."}

Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations."}

This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters--the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($ε_\\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)--and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \\simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \\ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \\lesssim 0.01\\,M_\\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \\sim 0.1\\,M_\\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $ε_\\star \\approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy--and thus the IR luminosity--nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer--induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z > 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \\simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation."}

The curvature decomposes into chiral sectors, and effective tetrads are introduced using components of the higher-dimensional connection. The resulting left and right sectors are formulated as constrained BF/Plebanski-like theories with appropriate simplicity and reality conditions. The six-dimensional theory yields two overlapping four-dimensional Lorentzian sectors of opposite signature, related via gluing constraints across their intersection.

To achieve a robust combination that accounts for the correlation between the two data releases, we employ the ShapeFit compression method and estimate the joint covariance using EZmocks. This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain--for the first time within a Bayesian framework--reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $Λ$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $Λ$CDM, we find $Ω_m = 0.3035 \\pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \\pm 0.0059$, and $σ_8 = 0.822 \\pm 0.034$. For the $w_0 w_a$CDM dynamical dark energy model, we measure $w_0 = 0.49 \\pm 0.25$ and $w_a = -1.52 \\pm 0.77$, improving constraints by $\\sim 30\\%$ relative to the analogous DR1 measurement and reducing the discrepancy with $Λ$CDM to $1.4σ$ when compared to BAO only analyses. We also report competitive limits on the sum of neutrino masses and spatial curvature. This work demonstrates that the ShapeFit compression provides a prior-robust and computationally efficient pathway to constrain beyond-$Λ$CDM physics with large-scale structure."}

Building on a previously developed formalism for ndimensional density matrices, we characterize each state by a normalized global purity index and two complementary indices, which quantify the contributions of level populations and coherences. This yields a simple quadratic relation and a geometric representation in a population-coherence plane, where different routes to purity can be distinguished. In the two-level case we construct explicit families of states with identical spectra and global purity but opposite internal structure, realizing population-dominated and coherence-dominated routes. We then apply this framework to a standard Page-type evaporation model without an explicit Hamiltonian, in which a black hole and its Hawking radiation form a bipartite pure state with varying Hilbert-space dimensions. Using known results for typical reduced states in large dimensions, we analyze the behavior of population and coherence components of purity along the evaporation process. Under the physically motivated requirement that, in this energy-free setting, the radiation populations remain nearly uniform in the chosen basis, we show that the late-time recovery of purity must be coherence-dominated: the global purity of the radiation approaches unity while the population index stays small and the coherence index carries essentially all the purity."}

We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 < z < 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 < z < 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 < z < 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z > 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift."}

Cosmological parameters are estimated through $χ^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $Λ$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $α$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase.

In linear $f(Q)$ gravity of the form $f(Q)=β_1 Q+β_2$, the theory is dynamically equivalent to General Relativity at the geometric level and modifies stellar structure solely through a uniform rescaling of the matter sector governed by $β_1$. Consequently, linear $f(Q)$ alone does not introduce new geometric families of stellar solutions or alter classical compactness bounds. To overcome this structural limitation, we incorporate gravitational decoupling within an embedding class-I (Karmarkar) Vaidya-Tikekar configuration in linear $f(Q)$ gravity. While similar VT-based decoupling constructions exist in GR, the present framework introduces a controlled two-parameter deformation characterized by $(ε,β_1)$: the decoupling parameter $ε$ governs geometric deformation and EOS stiffness, whereas $β_1$ independently rescales the matter sector without altering the metric structure. This separation permits a direct comparison between GR and linear $f(Q)$ gravity at fixed geometric deformation, thereby isolating pure coupling-driven mass enhancement. We determine the admissible parameter domain from regularity, matching, causality and compactness requirements and derive an analytic compactness bound for the decoupled embedding class-I configuration. The combined action of $ε$ and $β_1$ enlarges the accessible stellar mass window while preserving physical acceptability, allowing configurations compatible with recent high-mass pulsars and mass-gap candidates without exceeding causal limits."}

To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/dν to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core."}

Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or \"safety\" STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in ~5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to ~9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits, ~39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority (~78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here."}

We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years.

On the bulk side, we show that the coarse-grained entropy (outer entropy) of a generalized marginally trapped surface corresponds precisely to the Wald entropy associated with this surface. To get this result, we first formulate the AdS/CFT correspondence in the Einstein frame and derive the correspondence between von Neumann entropy of the Einstein frame and the $f(R)$ frame. This facilitates the derivation of the correspondence between the two outer entropies in the two frames. Furthermore, we directly derive a focusing theorem associated with generalized expansion in $f(R)$ gravity. We then formulate how to construct the stationary null hypersurface for the generalized expansion and the junction condition to glue a hypersurface in $f(R)$ gravity. Combining these results, we derive the expression for the entropy in the $f(R)$ frame and identify its holographic dual."}

Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera.

The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $η$ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \\times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \\times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $η$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \\times 10^{18}$ GeV.

We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures."}

This discovery catalyzed the development of quenched potential models, most notably the Cornell model, which provided a foundational quantitative description of the hadronic spectrum. However, the landscape of hadron spectroscopy has been profoundly transformed since the turn of the 21st century with the observation of numerous charmonium-like states, such as $X(3872)$, which exhibit properties starkly at odds with quenched model predictions. These discrepancies, exemplified by the \"$X(3872)$ low-mass puzzle\" and the \"$Y$ problem\" associated with vector states like $Y(4260)$, underscore the critical limitations of the quenched approximation and signal the necessity for a new theoretical paradigm. This review synthesizes recent advances in hadronic spectroscopy, arguing that the unquenched picture, which incorporates coupled-channel effects such as hadronic loops, is essential for a unified description of these new states and associated anomalies. We demonstrate how unquenched effects provide compelling solutions to long-standing puzzles in charmonium decays (e.g., the \"$ρπ$ puzzle\" and anomalous dipion transitions), predict and explain the existence of exotic charged states like $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_b(10610)$ via mechanisms such as Initial Single Pion Emission, and offer a framework for understanding interactions between charmonia and with nucleons. Furthermore, we emphasize the universality of unquenched effects, extending their application to bottomonium and light-flavor sectors. With improving precision, we advocate systematic development of unquenched hadronic spectroscopy."}

SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs."}

After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions.

The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship."}

We study a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer and derive closed-form expressions for the Lense--Thirring, geodetic, and general spin-precession frequencies. A sharp qualitative distinction emerges: for Kerr--Newman black holes, the spin-precession frequency generically diverges as the horizon is approached (remaining finite only for the ZAMO family), whereas for Kerr--Newman naked singularities, the precession remains finite throughout the spacetime, with divergences confined to the ring singularity on the equatorial plane. Working with physically admissible stationary observers (including ZAMOs), we first construct the timelike geodesic motion and the fundamental orbital frequencies for equatorial circular orbits. Using these, we analyse the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, the ISCO shift induced by the charge parameter $Q$, and the associated periastron and nodal precession frequencies relevant to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We demonstrate that nonzero $Q$ produces systematic, and in rapidly rotating regimes nontrivial, modifications to the frequency hierarchy: $ν_{\\rm nod}$ can develop a finite maximum at $r=r_p=\\mathcal{O}(M)$, its peak amplitude decreases with increasing $Q$, and sign reversals may occur for sufficiently large charge and high spin, signalling a reversal of nodal-precession orientation.

The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $γ$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $γ$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values.

Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT.

We discuss how these assumptions impact the standard scaling solutions, as well as the evolution of the string network density. In addition to simple power-law cosmological epochs solutions, we also discuss the behavior of the network during the radiation-to-matter and matter-to-acceleration transitions. Overall, our results show that for the same amount of tension variation, a change in the stretching length scale tends to have a more significant impact on the network than a change in the damping length."}

In optical radial coordinates, and using the Kodama--Ishibashi gauge-invariant formalism, each radiative multipole is encoded by a single scalar master field on the half-line. The resulting master equation is of Regge--Wheeler type, with an inverse-square potential core at the optical apex (controlled by a Hardy inequality) and a short-range tail at infinity. The spatial-plus-potential part of the Einstein--Maxwell $T$-energy is closable and bounded below, which defines a positive quadratic form on the natural energy space. Its Friedrichs extension then gives the canonical self-adjoint realization of the master operator. The static Coulomb field and its nonlinear gravitational backreaction are treated as the exact background. All linear Einstein--Maxwell perturbations with finite spatial $T$-energy evolve unitarily on the energy space. The naked singularity at finite optical distance is ``silent'' in the technical sense that it carries no $T$-energy flux. We also construct the forward radiation field at future null infinity, obtaining a translation representation of the self-field dynamics in which the conserved $T$-energy coincides with the $L^2$ norm of the radiation profile in retarded time."}

The Magnetic-field Evolution in Dwarf galaxies from Ultra-deep SKA Analysis (MEDUSA) survey is the first SKA-pathfinder programme designed to obtain deep continuum, polarisation, and HI data for dwarf galaxies, enabling a comprehensive study of their radio spectra, magnetic fields, and gas kinematics across a representative population. By analysing the radio continuum spectra and polarisation of the dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger NGC 1487 from the MEDUSA sample, we aim to determine its magnetic field strength and to characterise the large-scale and turbulent components of its magnetic field. We utilise highly sensitive multi-band radio continuum data from MeerKAT L-band (1.28 GHz) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) L/S (2.1 GHz), C (5.5 GHz), and X-bands (9 GHz). We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis. The integrated spectral energy distribution has a non-thermal spectral index of $α_{\\rm nth} = -0.678\\pm0.085$. Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $ν_{\\rm b} = 6.2\\pm1.3$ GHz. In star-forming regions, the magnetic field exhibits strong small-scale fluctuations in RM, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo. Conversely, the field becomes more ordered, aligning with the tidal arms toward the galaxy's outskirts, showing a large-scale magnetic field over $\\approx3$ kpc. Observations of the dwarf-dwarf merger NGC 1487 show that even low-mass galaxy mergers, likely the building blocks of larger galaxies in the early Universe, can rapidly amplify and produce coherent large-scale magnetic field structures, highlighting their key contribution in the early magnetisation of galaxies."}

We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes.

Spatial auto-correlation analysis of near-horizon turbulence confirms larger energy-containing coherent structures in the perturbed case altering the accretion rate.

We propose a new approach for CEvNS measurements at the SNS that aims to complement the COHERENT experiments in two main ways: by reconstructing the angular distribution of CEvNS-induced recoils, and by measuring CEvNS on much lighter target nuclei such as helium, carbon, and fluorine. The proposed detector would employ a gaseous time-projection chamber with a highly segmented charge readout to enable the spatial reconstruction of $\\sim$10-500 keV ionisation tracks created by CEvNS-induced recoils. This would enable the simultaneous measurement of the CEvNS recoil energy and scattering angle, thereby allowing event-by-event reconstruction of the neutrino energy. We estimate that a 60:40 He:CF$_4$ gas mixture at atmospheric pressure offers a good trade-off between total target mass and good directionality and could deliver a detection of the angular distribution of CEvNS, even under pessimistic background conditions. We project the sensitivity of 1 and 10 m$^3$-scale detectors in the context of several physics cases, including: the measurement of the Standard Model CEvNS cross section, reconstruction of the flavour-dependent neutrino fluxes, observing the neutrino-induced Migdal effect, constraints on beyond-Standard Model neutrino interactions, and probing 10-eV-scale sterile neutrinos."}

Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r) ~ 25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r) ~ 40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin."}

After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide."}

The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.\n  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.\n  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program."}

Specifically, we aim to constrain the behavior of α-element enhancements with metallicity, the dependence of [α/Fe] on the specific star formation rate (sSFR), and the absorption-line velocity widths (Δv90) vs. stellar mass, Δv90 vs. metallicity, and mass-metallicity relations. For the comparison, we select five galaxies simulated with the chemodynamical Tree-SPH code GEAR with stellar masses in the range of log(M*/Msol) between 6.1 and 10.8, and at six different redshifts between 0.33 and 4.12. We find that the abundance ratios [α/Fe] and [M/H] observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) of DLA galaxies overlap with the abundance trends in gas of the simulated galaxies. Our findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs with Δv90 below and above 100 km/s trace galaxies with masses in the ranges of log M* 6 - 8 and 8 - 11 solar masses, respectively. We suggest that observations should be used with caution when constraining the theoretical [α/Fe] vs. sSFR relations because of systematics (if abundances are obtained from emission lines) or differences in the gas properties as probed by a DLA and its counterpart. So far, only the observations in absorption of inner gas of the LMC and SMC are in agreement with the simulated data. We confirm that DLAs detected at large impact parameters most likely probe the gas of satellite or other halo galaxies which are adjacent to the central galaxy. We further find that the velocity widths vs. stellar masses and mass-metallicity relations agree well with observations, while GEAR should be calibrated more carefully to reproduce the Δv90 vs. metallicity relation."}

Within a unified dynamical framework, we analyze test-particle motion in a broad class of dark-matter-embedded geometries, including singular black holes, regular black holes, naked singularities, and Einstein-cluster configurations. We show that environmental perturbations generically break integrability in the strong-field regime, giving rise to chaotic motion whose onset, duration, and termination depend sensitively on horizon structure, core regularization, and matter distribution. Using the numerical Kludge approach, we demonstrate that chaotic trajectories produce systematic qualitative modifications of the emitted gravitational radiation, such as irregular amplitude modulation and loss of phase coherence, in contrast to the smooth, quasi-periodic waveforms generated by regular motion. Our results establish the robustness of chaos in environmentally perturbed EMRIs and provide a clear conceptual link between nonlinear orbital dynamics, spacetime structure, and observable gravitational-wave signatures."}

For FLRW cosmologies, we demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet terms can replace the Big Bang/Crunch with a \"sudden\" singularity, characterized by a finite scale factor and Hubble rate but diverging higher-order derivatives. Investigating various branches of solutions shows the possibility of explicit extension of non-spacelike geodesics beyond the singular point. Furthermore, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet junction conditions to verify the consistency of the extension with the field equations. The whole solution describes a contracting phase prior to the expansion phase with a well-defined surface stress-energy tensor. Regarding the Boulware-Deser black hole, we find that Gauss-Bonnet terms soften the central singularity for radial geodesics--rendering them \"weak\" according to the Tipler and Krolak criteria--whereas non-radial geodesics remain strongly singular. Junction condition analysis of this solution shows that although higher-curvature corrections alter the nature of the singularity, geodesics are still inextendible as a result of divergent extrinsic curvature. Our results are consistent with the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems since in Gauss-Bonnet black holes, geodesics suffer from focusing (expansion parameter diverges), while in cosmology, there is no focusing since the expansion parameter remains finite at the singularity."}

Such a feature makes them key objects that can be used to constrain the duty cycle of RGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of J022248\\m060934, a new TDRG, hosted by a galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift of $z \\approx$ 0.94. We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity. Our spectral ageing analysis suggests that the triple-double structure in TDRGs is not the product of long quiescent periods, as deduced by previous works based on kinematic ages."}

We utilise highly sensitive multi-band radio continuum data from MeerKAT L-band (1.28 GHz) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) L/S (2.1 GHz), C (5.5 GHz), and X-bands (9 GHz). We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis.

Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $ν_{\\rm b} = 6.2\\pm1.3$ GHz.

As a concrete application, we examine a binary black hole system and show how Lorentz violation alters the observed strain through shifted retarded times, amplitude rescaling, and higher derivative corrections to the quadrupole formula. The CPT-odd term produces characteristic attenuation and distortions in the waveform, which can be interpreted as energy exchange between the gravitational wave and the Lorentz-violating background rather than a violation of energy conservation.

Mixed WIMP-FIMP (and fully feeble FIMP-FIMP) histories reopen regions excluded in thermal two-WIMP interpretations, since the total relic density can be shared while the direct-detection signal is carried only by the thermal fraction. For the unstable hierarchy $M_{S_B}>2M_{S_A}$, we identify decay-dominated regimes-SuperWIMP, injection-assisted freeze-out, and sequential freeze-in (``SuperFIMP'')-where late dark-sector injection sets the final $S_A$ abundance.

In this work, we study leptophilic scalar DM in a $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, which provides a common leptophilic portal for all scenarios considered. To reproduce the observed relic abundance while suppressing direct-detection signals, we investigate three benchmark realizations: (i) a secluded DM scenario in which the relic density is set by annihilation into $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge bosons, and two pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM models based on (ii) an SO(4) symmetry and (iii) an SO(3) symmetry. In the SO(4) pNGB model, the DM mass arises at tree level from a soft breaking term, while the elastic scattering amplitude is suppressed by a symmetry-protected cancellation. In the SO(3) pNGB model, the DM mass is generated radiatively at one loop via the $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge interaction, and we show that this gauging preserves the same cancellation mechanism, maintaining compatibility with direct-detection null results. We perform a systematic parameter scan imposing relic density, direct- and indirect-detection, and neutrino trident constraints, and identify viable sub-TeV to TeV DM candidates. Assuming maximal capture in NSs, we find that the remaining parameter space can be tested by near-infrared observations of NSs, providing sensitivity complementary to terrestrial searches in regions that are currently weakly constrained."}

We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs.

The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin.

Spherical harmonic expansions must be truncated at finite multipole l_max^rec, often set to l_max^N_pair$\\equiv {\\rm int}\\left[\\sqrt{\\text{N_pair}}-1\\right]$, where N_pair is the number of distinct pulsar pairs in an array. This choice is motivated by the counting argument that cross-correlations provide at most N_pair independent constraints. We obtain the multipole l_max^res corresponding to the maximum informative angular scale of a PTA. It is defined such that expansions to l_max^res (approximately) span the space of \"observable skies\" encoded in the N_pair eigenmaps of the Fisher information matrix, and therefore depends on the array configuration. We explicitly show that GWB power contained in multipoles l$\\gtrsim$l_max^res do not significantly affect analyses that use expansions out to l_max^res, because the PTA response acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, truncating at l_max^rec< l_max^res leads to leakage of small-scale angular power from l_max^rec<l$\\leq$l_max^res. Even choosing l_max^rec=l_max^res, the standard frequentist estimator of the angular power spectrum C_l remains biased by the modes unobservable by the array.

Here we develop a conformal formulation of black-hole perturbation theory based on the CEFEs and derive the conformal Teukolsky equation. Starting from a transparent review of Friedrich's regularisation strategy, this work establishes a direct connection between mainstream curvature-based linear perturbation theory and conformal formulations of general relativity. This perspective is timely given the growing relevance of hyperboloidal frameworks in black-hole perturbation theory, where conformal compactification is introduced at the level of an already linearised effective wave equation. Here instead, the conformal factor is a dynamical variable within the field equations. In the non-linear equations there is a coupling between conformal and curvature perturbations; however, when linearised around a Petrov-type D background, the conformal factor decouples from the equations governing the Newman-Penrose components $φ_0$ and $φ_4$ of the rescaled Weyl tensor. The resulting equation preserves the structural form of the classical Teukolsky equation while remaining regular at the conformal boundary. This provides a geometric interpretation of the hyperboloidal master variable and an entry point into the CEFE framework. We further derive the conformal Teukolsky equation for a conformal representation of Kerr spacetime where spatial infinity is realised as a blown-up cylinder. By bridging conformal and traditional approaches to black-hole perturbation theory, the framework highlights a geometrically regular representation of perturbative dynamics that may inform extensions beyond the linear regime."}

To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \\textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $θ_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \\leq m/M \\leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $θ_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis."}

This discovery catalyzed the development of quenched potential models, most notably the Cornell model, which provided a foundational quantitative description of the hadronic spectrum. However, the landscape of hadron spectroscopy has been profoundly transformed since the turn of the 21st century with the observation of numerous charmonium-like states, such as $X(3872)$, which exhibit properties starkly at odds with quenched model predictions. These discrepancies, exemplified by the \"$X(3872)$ low-mass puzzle\" and the \"$Y$ problem\" associated with vector states like $Y(4260)$, underscore the critical limitations of the quenched approximation and signal the necessity for a new theoretical paradigm. This review synthesizes recent advances in hadronic spectroscopy, arguing that the unquenched picture, which incorporates coupled-channel effects such as hadronic loops, is essential for a unified description of these new states and associated anomalies. We demonstrate how unquenched effects provide compelling solutions to long-standing puzzles in charmonium decays (e.g., the \"$ρπ$ puzzle\" and anomalous dipion transitions), predict and explain the existence of exotic charged states like $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_b(10610)$ via mechanisms such as Initial Single Pion Emission, and offer a framework for understanding interactions between charmonia and with nucleons. Furthermore, we emphasize the universality of unquenched effects, extending their application to bottomonium and light-flavor sectors. With improving precision, we advocate systematic development of unquenched hadronic spectroscopy."}

By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments.

Building on the default Herwig 7 treatment based on the Dawson-subtracted longitudinal current, we construct a gauge-invariant longitudinal scheme in which the Dawson remainder is retained as a well-defined contribution and completed by a Ward-identity-fixed Goldstone-matching term. We derive helicity-resolved building blocks and compact quasi-collinear splitting kernels for $q\\to q'V$ and $V\\to V'V''$ branchings, and implement the scheme in Herwig 7 as a switchable alternative to the default longitudinal basis. The completion leaves the transverse sector unchanged and modifies only longitudinal entries through controlled symmetry-breaking terms, including Yukawa-sensitive contributions in massive-fermion channels. In shower-level studies, we find that the Dawson and gauge-invariant prescriptions coincide at high evolution scales, while differing at lower scales precisely in channels where symmetry breaking is active. Exclusive single-emission observables can moreover display non-monotonic scheme dependence once Sudakov suppression and kinematic constraints are accounted for. A first multi-emission LHC-like study confirms numerical stability and yields controlled, interpretable shifts in observables that probe propagating electroweak shower currents, whereas quantities dominated by promptly contracted, near on-shell vector-boson matrix elements remain largely unchanged."}

We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.

Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}>0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism.

We explore this type of production through the Inert Doublet Model plus a complex Singlet (IDMS), where an extension of the Standard Model by an additional $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a $SU(2)$ inert scalar doublet gives rise to a DM candidate $χ$. This particular process involves the collision of two protons exchanging two colorless particles (in our case, photons), from which a central process occurs. Such interaction can be detected in the LHC using forward proton detectors, where the resulting missing mass spectrum can be observed after proton reconstruction, thus allowing a search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We present results for different values of the difference of masses of a heavy scalar coming from the complex singlet, the DM candidate and the Higgs boson, $Δ= M_S - M_χ- M_h$, which is the phase space available for the final state in the central exclusive process."}

Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations."}

In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae.

Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $β$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($β= 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $β$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $β$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys."}

For FLRW cosmologies, we demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet terms can replace the Big Bang/Crunch with a \"sudden\" singularity, characterized by a finite scale factor and Hubble rate but diverging higher-order derivatives. Investigating various branches of solutions shows the possibility of explicit extension of non-spacelike geodesics beyond the singular point. Furthermore, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet junction conditions to verify the consistency of the extension with the field equations. The whole solution describes a contracting phase prior to the expansion phase with a well-defined surface stress-energy tensor. Regarding the Boulware-Deser black hole, we find that Gauss-Bonnet terms soften the central singularity for radial geodesics--rendering them \"weak\" according to the Tipler and Krolak criteria--whereas non-radial geodesics remain strongly singular. Junction condition analysis of this solution shows that although higher-curvature corrections alter the nature of the singularity, geodesics are still inextendible as a result of divergent extrinsic curvature. Our results are consistent with the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems since in Gauss-Bonnet black holes, geodesics suffer from focusing (expansion parameter diverges), while in cosmology, there is no focusing since the expansion parameter remains finite at the singularity."}

The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $η$ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \\times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \\times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $η$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \\times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $η$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $η= 8.65 \\times 10^{-11}$.

For each geometry, we integrate the timelike geodesic equations and consistently project the resulting trajectories onto astrometric and spectroscopic observables, incorporating Rømer time delay and relativistic redshift effects. The theoretical predictions are tested with current Very Large Telescope (VLT) observations of the S2 star, while simultaneously imposing constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope shadow size. We find that several spacetimes that are degenerate at the level of shadow imaging, most notably Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, and Bardeen regular black hole geometries, remain statistically indistinguishable when tested against present S2 data. We further carry out a statistical model comparison based on the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) to evaluate the relative performance of the alternative spacetime models. Our analysis also constrains the generalized charge like parameter $q/M$ in non-Schwarzschild spacetimes based on current S2 star observations, and identifies specific black hole and horizonless geometries that can be further tested with forthcoming high precision astrometric observations from the VLT and Keck telescopes."}

As a concrete application, we examine a binary black hole system and show how Lorentz violation alters the observed strain through shifted retarded times, amplitude rescaling, and higher derivative corrections to the quadrupole formula. The CPT-odd term produces characteristic attenuation and distortions in the waveform, which can be interpreted as energy exchange between the gravitational wave and the Lorentz-violating background rather than a violation of energy conservation.

We focus on the resulting renormalisation-group-improved Schwarzschild metric, which naturally yields a finite-size Planck-density core. Building on this background, we compute the QNM spectrum for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using the Spectral Method (SM). This approach, known for its superior accuracy over high-order WKB schemes, enables the detection of fundamental modes, large families of overtones, and purely imaginary overdamped modes that are entirely missed in previous analysis. Our results reveal a robust Martini glass morphology of the oscillatory spectrum across perturbation sectors, nearly equally spaced overdamped modes with characteristic anomalous gaps, and the emergence, in the gravitational sector, of isolated overdamped modes separated from the main sequence by exceptionally large frequency intervals.

As a consequence, the associated running Newton coupling does not realise the ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotically safe gravity, and the geometry should be interpreted as an SDG-inspired effective metric rather than a realisation of asymptotically safe gravity itself. We focus on the resulting renormalisation-group-improved Schwarzschild metric, which naturally yields a finite-size Planck-density core. Building on this background, we compute the QNM spectrum for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using the Spectral Method (SM). This approach, known for its superior accuracy over high-order WKB schemes, enables the detection of fundamental modes, large families of overtones, and purely imaginary overdamped modes that are entirely missed in previous analysis. Our results reveal a robust Martini glass morphology of the oscillatory spectrum across perturbation sectors, nearly equally spaced overdamped modes with characteristic anomalous gaps, and the emergence, in the gravitational sector, of isolated overdamped modes separated from the main sequence by exceptionally large frequency intervals. These features, resolved here for the first time in the Planck-star context, underscore the importance of high-precision spectral techniques in probing subtle signatures of quantum-gravity-inspired black hole models."}

Spherical harmonic expansions must be truncated at finite multipole l_max^rec, often set to l_max^N_pair$\\equiv {\\rm int}\\left[\\sqrt{\\text{N_pair}}-1\\right]$, where N_pair is the number of distinct pulsar pairs in an array. This choice is motivated by the counting argument that cross-correlations provide at most N_pair independent constraints. We obtain the multipole l_max^res corresponding to the maximum informative angular scale of a PTA. It is defined such that expansions to l_max^res (approximately) span the space of \"observable skies\" encoded in the N_pair eigenmaps of the Fisher information matrix, and therefore depends on the array configuration. We explicitly show that GWB power contained in multipoles l$\\gtrsim$l_max^res do not significantly affect analyses that use expansions out to l_max^res, because the PTA response acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, truncating at l_max^rec< l_max^res leads to leakage of small-scale angular power from l_max^rec<l$\\leq$l_max^res. Even choosing l_max^rec=l_max^res, the standard frequentist estimator of the angular power spectrum C_l remains biased by the modes unobservable by the array. Although we can (partially) debias the standard estimator -- improving its agreement with an injected spectrum -- this reduction in bias comes at the expense of an increase in variance, particularly for poorly constrained modes with l$\\gg$l_eff. We therefore recommend: (i) using l_max^res for PTA analyses involving spherical harmonic expansions, and (ii) using the debiased standard estimator for C_l recovery, but only out to multipoles l<l_eff ($\\ll$l_max^res) corresponding to sufficiently constrained modes."}

In particular, on the sphere, our results reveal phenomena that contrast with the well-known achievements on compact manifolds without conformal Killing vector fields, including nonexistence of solutions in the near-CMC regime and instability when the mean curvature is non-constant. By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.\n  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical.

When the bare cosmological constant is precisely fine-tuned to $Λ= 1/(8α)$, the scalar curvature is fixed such that the derivative $f'(R)=1+2αR$ identically vanishes, demonstrating that the family represents a pathological $R_0$-degenerate boundary of the viable physical states. This mathematical degeneracy decouples the modified field equations, permitting the existence of an arbitrary $1/r^2$ integration constant in the metric, which functions as a purely geometric, Reissner-Nordström hair mimicker. However, any infinitesimal deviation from this exact boundary instantaneously destroys the degeneracy, rigorously forcing the geometric hair to vanish and collapsing the spacetime back into the standard Schwarzschild-de Sitter family. We provide the exact algebraic derivation of this spacetime and highlight its physical pathologies, including the identically vanishing Wald entropy of the associated black hole horizons, the divergence of the effective gravitational coupling, the resulting backreaction catastrophe, and the onset of severe ghost instabilities. Ultimately, this exact solution functions as a rigorous no-go theorem within the Starobinsky model, pedagogically illustrating the extreme fragility and physical hostility of degenerate, purely mathematical solutions in highly non-linear $f(R)$ gravity theories."}

The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase.

Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole.

The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT.
