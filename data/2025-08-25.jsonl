Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved\nspacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme\ngravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and\nearly universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating\ngeneral relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we\ndemonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star\ninteriors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis\nreveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial\ndependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming\nsignificant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it\nexists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3\npc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in\ngalactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence\neffects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than\npreviously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of\ncosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme\nconditions."}

Establishing the quality of the 2D reconstruction of the filaments of the cosmic web with DisPerSE using Euclid photometric redshifts", "comment": "27 pages, 14 Figures", "summary": "Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the\nUniverse. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify\nfilaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these\nmethods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled\nspectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the\nfilaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric\nredshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of\nlarger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift\nprecision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments\nextracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific\nsurvey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of\nfilament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid\nWide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare\ntwo filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the\nEuclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm\nDisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution\nand Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several\ncharacteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare\nskeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy\npositions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between\nfilaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical\nconsiderations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We\nassess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify\nfilaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey. [abridged]"}

Our sample consists of retrograde halo\nstars with low orbital inclinations and intermediate eccentricities ($0.5 < e\n\\leq 0.7$), drawn from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopy combined with $Gaia$ DR3\nastrometry.

Establishing the quality of the 2D reconstruction of the filaments of the cosmic web with DisPerSE using Euclid photometric redshifts", "comment": "27 pages, 14 Figures", "summary": "Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the\nUniverse. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify\nfilaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these\nmethods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled\nspectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the\nfilaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric\nredshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of\nlarger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift\nprecision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments\nextracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific\nsurvey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of\nfilament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid\nWide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare\ntwo filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the\nEuclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm\nDisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution\nand Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several\ncharacteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare\nskeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy\npositions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between\nfilaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical\nconsiderations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We\nassess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify\nfilaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey. [abridged]"}

In the context of the DUNE experiment, we estimate the number of\nsupernova neutrino events in the presence of scalar non-standard neutrino\ninteraction $\\eta_{\\mu\\mu}$ or $\\eta_{\\tau\\tau}$ and contrast with the case\nwithout scalar-mediated non-standard interactions. Our results indicate that\nsuch scalar interactions introduce a new degeneracy in the measurement of\nneutrino mass ordering from supernova neutrinos. We show how the $\\bar{\\nu}_e$\nevent distribution in Hyper-Kamiokande experiment can help resolve the\ndegeneracy between a model with new scalar interactions for normal ordered\nneutrino masses and the standard model with inverted mass ordering."}

SNSI modify the resonant\nflavor conversion and, correspondingly, the neutronization burst signal, and\nmay be identifiable in future multi-tonne-scale experiments such as DUNE. We\nshow that, in the presence of SNSI, neutrinos propagating out of the dense\nsupernova environment acquire a density-squared-dependent contribution to their\nmass-squared differences, which in turn modifies the energy levels of the\nneutrino mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is not present in less dense\nenvironments like the Earth or the Sun. For a given mass ordering, supernova\nneutrinos can improve the sensitivity to SNSI parameters by up to four orders\nof magnitude compared to that achievable with solar or terrestrial neutrino\nsources."}

Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved\nspacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme\ngravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and\nearly universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating\ngeneral relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we\ndemonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star\ninteriors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis\nreveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial\ndependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming\nsignificant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it\nexists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3\npc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in\ngalactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence\neffects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than\npreviously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of\ncosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme\nconditions."}

We analyze the exponential\n(EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We\ndetermine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for\nthree dark energy (DE) models -- $\\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four\nneutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted)\nand multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus,\nCMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with\nphysical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our\nresults show that CPL yields tighter ($\\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We\nfurther confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly\nsensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter\nthan Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the\ndatasets used and the cosmological model play a crucial role in the inferred\ncosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE\nparameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for\nnonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits."}
