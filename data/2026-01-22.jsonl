By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns."}

Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles."}

Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline.

While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montréal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains."}

Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure.

It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "The rapid emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe poses a challenge to current models of black hole growth. One promising formation pathway is the direct collapse black hole (DCBH) scenario, in which gas in pristine, low-metallicity halos forms supermassive (or quasi-) stars leading to massive black holes seeds under specific environmental conditions. In this work, we investigate the potential host environments of DCBHs by coupling a semi-analytic model tracing BH formation and galaxy co-evolution with high-resolution N-body dark matter merger trees. This allows us to trace the population of DCBHs formed during the hierarchical assembly of a $\\sim 10^{12} ~\\rm M_\\odot$ dark matter halo hosting a bright $10^9 ~\\rm M_\\odot$ quasar at redshift $z \\approx 7$. We find that, when accounting for local fluctuations in the UV radiation field within this early cosmic structure, massive BH seeds can form via direct collapse as early as $z \\approx 22$. Even under more stringent conditions for heavy seed formation, tens of DCBHs are predicted to emerge within the simulated overdensity down to $z \\sim 14$, at which point metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium inhibits further episodes of direct collapse. A significant fraction of the massive black hole population formed at $z > 14$ is expected to survive in satellite galaxies that do not merge with the central halo down to $z \\approx 7$. We show that the existence of such a population of ungrown heavy BH seeds can be probed through deep JWST observations targeting regions surrounding bright high-redshift quasars, and we discuss tailored observational strategies to detect and identify these elusive systems."}

Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $η/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T>T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $ζ/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied."}

As these photons travel through the intergalactic medium, their scattering cross-section is often approximated as a delta function at resonance due to computational cost. That is, photons with emitted wavelengths between Ly$α$ and Ly$β$ are assumed to travel in straight lines until they redshift into the Ly$α$ resonance. However, due to the damping wing in the Ly$α$ cross-section, this approximation fails as the frequency of the photon approaches the resonant frequency, resulting in multiple scatterings events that could be separated by non-negligible distances. Some previous works studied this effect of Ly$α$ multiple scattering by running computationally heavy radiative-transfer simulations. However, robustly interpreting the cosmic 21cm signal requires exploring a large parameter space of astrophysical uncertainties, motivating more computationally-efficient approaches. Here we incorporate Ly$α$ multiple scatterings in the public, semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the trajectories of Ly$α$ photons on different scales. We find that the distance distributions of Ly$α$ photons with respect to the absorption point can be modeled as analytical functions that are governed by a single parameter. Upon implementing the distance distributions in 21cmFAST, we find that the multiple scattering effect is important (about 50% difference in the 21-cm power spectrum) only at high redshifts before the spin temperature is fully coupled to the kinetic temperature. Furthermore, we find that Ly$α$ multiple scattering does not enhance Ly$α$ heating, and that the combined effect is negligible, especially under realistic X-ray heating scenarios."}

Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case."}

We introduce a method that relies exclusively on tracking individual maser components, rather than assuming a single averaged trajectory as in previous works, thereby avoiding arbitrary data averaging that can bias interpretations of the disk's geometry and dynamics. This approach requires spatially resolved individual maser components; consequently, the majority of observational epochs were excluded, as they lack sufficient spatial resolution to localize the maser position. We track individual maser components across multiple epochs and introduce an efficient marginalization method over nuisance parameters (angular radius and azimuth of each maser), reducing the number of free parameters from hundreds to 14. Our analysis reveals that the current observational cadence is insufficient to reliably track the individual masers, which our method relies on, given their intrinsic variability. Across a range of maser selections and model configurations, inferred distances span approximately between 6.7 to 8.1 Mpc, demonstrating significant sensitivity to how our method selects individual masers. Even visually and statistically robust fits can differ by several standard deviations, reflecting ambiguity in component identification across sparsely sampled epochs. We evaluate the impact of observational cadence on tracking fidelity and distance precision, and show that high-cadence monitoring is needed for our method to track individual masers and produce a robust anchor for cosmology."}

We show that, if the condition of charge quantization is relaxed, the anomaly-free $B-L$ charges of two out of three right-handed neutrinos can be enhanced by arbitrarily large factors, while all other fermions retain their canonical charges. We call this setup as `enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' and promote it to be local. As long as this enhanced $B-L$ gauge symmetry remains unbroken, neutrinos stay chiral and massless at low energies. Nonzero neutrino masses then require sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking order parameters, which we associate with gravity-induced neutrino condensate. If the enhancement is large and the $B-L$ gauge boson $A'$ is lighter than the heaviest neutrino, then the neutrino decay into $A'$ directly constrains the gauge coupling, which can be significantly stronger than the baryon-based fifth-force tests. Through kinetic mixing with the photon, $A'$ can also mediate neutrino-electron and coherent neutrino-nucleus scatterings, leading to possible signatures in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors."}

Fueled by advances in theory, simulations, and observations, void science has matured into a precision tool for constraining the parameters of the standard cosmological model and its possible extensions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the statistical tools developed to characterize voids, the theoretical models that link them to cosmological parameters, and the methodologies used to extract information from survey data. We highlight the growing synergy between void-based observables and other cosmological probes, and showcase the increasingly stringent constraints derived from voids measured from current survey data and expected from future missions. With the advent of the next generation of galaxy surveys, voids are poised to play a central role in the future of cosmology, turning what was once regarded as emptiness into one of the most promising frontiers of fundamental science."}

By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge."}

When pairs of mirror images of such star clusters appear across the lensing critical curve, it is usually assumed that both images will display identical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, this assumption may be invalidated in the presence of gravitational microlensing from stars or other compact objects in the lens, since microlensing will affect the SED contribution from bright stars within the star cluster independently in the two mirror images. Here, we explore under what circumstances mismatched mirror-image SEDs are likely to be observable, and argue that SED differences detectable in JWST observations of lensing-cluster fields will be limited to star clusters of mass $< 10^5\\ M_\\odot$ and ages $\\lesssim 5$ Myr. The probability of severely mismatched mirror-image SEDs increases if the stellar initial mass function is very top-heavy and extends to stellar masses $\\gg 100\\ M_\\odot$, as has been suggested to be the case for Population III stars. The prevalence of lensed star clusters with highly discrepant mirror-image SEDs could therefore serve as a probe of very massive stars and extreme stellar populations in the early Universe."}

The resulting in-medium Hamiltonian rotates CKM mixing angles into large effective lepton mixings, naturally realizing quark--lepton complementarity without invoking new flavor symmetries.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena."}

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Extended warm and cold gas nebulae, with complex morphologies and kinematics, have been observed in the centres of cool-core galaxy clusters. Their origin within the hot intracluster medium (ICM) is still puzzling, and among many mechanisms, positive feedback from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed. In this work, we performed a suite of very high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cool-core galaxy cluster subject to self-regulated AGN jet feedback, which leads to realistic ICM properties. By explicitly following warm ionized, neutral, and molecular gas phases, we studied the complex interplay between AGN activity and the multi-phase ICM. While AGN feedback globally heats the ICM, we find that during the individual AGN jet bursts, hot material is also injected laterally to the jet axis, within the turbulent mixing layer. This material, as it expands, compresses the surrounding hot ICM, reducing the local cooling time, and leads to the formation of cold clumps on a characteristic timescale of $\\sim 30$ Myr. By employing tracers, we explicitly track cooling within the affected regions, finding that very hot gas identified in high-compression, low-vorticity zones condenses in situ to form cold clumps. A statistical analysis reveals that the condensation of cold gas is highly promoted once the local turbulent Mach number, $σ_{hot}/c_{s,hot}$, in the hot gas component ($T \\geq 10^7$ K) takes values around ~0.3. The presented process is a further important step in understanding the physical mechanisms that lead to the formation of cold gas in the cluster core. Our measured values of the characteristic turbulent Mach number, together with detailed multi-phase gas kinematics predictions, provide important theoretical tools to interpret future X-ray spectroscopy and deep radio data, ultimately to constrain the origin of cool-core cluster nebulae."}

The intersection of ten compatible 3|3 channels with two compatible 2-particle channels collapses to a unique one-dimensional candidate line.

We find that an orbit-mixed form, a linear combination over 20 permutation images indexed by bipartitions, satisfies the crossing constraint.

In the residual X-ray surface brightness maps, where the global ICM distribution has been subtracted, cold fronts generated by gas sloshing are observed at the boundaries of the spiral excesses. We perform a systematic and comprehensive study of the surface brightness edges along the spiral excesses. We find the deficit of the thermal pressure radially inward of the brightness edges, in contrast to stripping cold fronts that typically exhibit higher thermal pressure in brightness edges. Assuming that the sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness distributions are sustained entirely by the gas bulk motions, we estimate the velocity gradients across the edges that are required to compensate for the deficit of the thermal pressure. We do not find statistically significant velocity gradients along the azimuthal direction. Our results suggest that alternative mechanisms such as magnetic fields and viscosity are necessary to maintain the sharpness of sloshing cold fronts."}

This growth is enabled by our novel black hole seeding prescription and the unprecedented resolution of our zoom-in cosmological simulations, which resolve the dense environments necessary for efficient accretion.

A4 is spontaneously broken by a scalar called the flavon, and when this happens a number of degenerate vacua can form, resulting in so-called domain walls. These objects are not observed and hence need to be annihilated. This is usually done by explicitly breaking A4 by adding a bias term to the scalar potential. In this paper, we construct a new model invariant under A4 and Z4, which creates cosmologically viable domain walls, lifts the degeneracy of the vacuum giving a natural mechanism for domain walls to annihilate, as well as predicts realistic neutrino mixing angles; all utilizing cross couplings between flavons. The annihilation of the domain walls, with proper choice of wall tension and the consequent bias term, leads to a gravitational wave signal that is potentially detectable in near future gravitational wave experiments, and interestingly intersects with the observed Pulsar Timing Array signal."}

Here we instead consider a setup in which a standard inflaton drives the background evolution, while excitations of a ghost condensate act as spectator fields that interact with the inflaton. This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $ω\\propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks.

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$."}

However, our galaxy also contains a non-axisymmetric stellar bar, which traps stars in resonant orbits, leading to substructures in phase-space. Using a high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we explore the connection between the bar and the accreted stellar halo. We find that the bar induces prominent substructures, or \"ridges\", in E-Lz, caused by the resonances. The most pronounced of these is caused by the corotation and the retrograde 1:1 resonances, with weaker ridges visible due to the prograde 1:1 and outer Lindblad resonance. The ridges are present across much of the stellar halo, with variations in radius due to the morphology of different orbital families. We explore the scattering of orbits at the resonances, finding that stars trapped at the 1:1 retrograde resonance become more circularised and have more negative angular momentum. Additionally, stars can move between the corotation and retrograde 1:1 families, thus alternating between prograde and retrograde motion. Due to these scatterings and the pre-existing metallicity gradients in the accreted population, the bar-induced substructures have distinct metallicities compared to stars in the surrounding phase-space. Our results suggest the need for caution when searching the Milky Way stellar halo for accreted substructures in both integral of motions and chemical spaces, since these can be induced by internal perturbations."}

The largest and least biased statistical samples of galaxies for use in clustering analyses can be collected photometrically through large imaging surveys. However, selecting clean photometric subsamples for cosmology are crucial for avoiding contamination that can bias cosmological constraints. Here we present the MagLim++ galaxy sample, selected to optimize for cosmological constraining power and incorporating an array of novel quality cuts to identify and remove residual contamination. This sample comes from the full six years of observations from the Dark Energy Survey. We present measurements of the two-point angular clustering ($w(θ)$) of 9,186,205 galaxies distributed over 4031 sq. degrees and in six tomographic redshift bins centered at $\\bar{z}\\approx$ [0.31, 0.44, 0.62, 0.78, 0.90, 1.01].

We describe the battery of null tests and mitigation schemes implemented to address observational, astrophysical, and methodological systematics in the analysis.

Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter λ of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from λ = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter λ of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength. The evolutionary characteristics of the DM bar are strongly influenced by the initial spin of the host halo."}

Of these sources, 10 have confident redshifts, and an additional 2 have tentative redshifts from likely Ly$α$ emission (including seven new redshifts determined here adding to those presented previously in Sheu et al.

In total, we identify 43 images of these 13 sources. This lens system is remarkably symmetric and well-modeled by a simpler lens model than typical cluster lenses, and the large number of sources and their large range of redshifts make this cluster ideal for constraining cosmological parameters such as $w$ and $Ω_m$ as well as the cluster density profile.

We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $ν\\barν$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars."}

By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes."}

Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries."}

In the age of large Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys, studies of the AGN-SF connection greatly benefit from spatially resolving AGN and SF contributions to study the two processes independently. Using IFU data for 54 local active galaxies from the S7 sample, we present a new method to separate emission from AGN activity and SF using mixing sequences observed in the [NII]$λ6584$/H$α$ vs. [OIII]$λ5007$/H$β$ Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We use the new decomposition method to calculate the H$α$ star-formation rate and AGN [OIII] luminosity for the galaxies. Our new method is robust to outliers in the line-ratio distribution and can be applied to large galaxy samples with little manual intervention. We infer star-formation histories (SFHs) using pPXF, conducting detailed recovery tests to determine the quantities that can be considered robust. We test the correlation between the AGN Eddington ratio, using the proxy L[OIII]/$σ_*^4$, and star-formation properties. We find a moderately strong correlation between the Eddington ratio and the star-formation rate (SFR). We also observe marginally significant correlations between the AGN Eddington ratio and the light-weighted stellar age under 100 Myr. Our results point to higher AGN accretion being associated with young nuclear star formation under 100 Myr, consistent with timelines presented in previous studies. The correlations found in this paper are relatively weak; extending our methods to larger samples, including radio-quiet galaxies, will help better constrain the physical mechanisms and timescales of the AGN-SF connection."}

In order to investigate how well radio luminosity traces star formation rate (SFR) in the early Universe, we have examined the radio properties of a JWST Paschen-alpha sample of galaxies at 1.0<=z<=1.8. In the GOODS-S field, we cross-matched a sample of 506 FRESCO Paschen-alpha emitters with the 1.23 GHz radio continuum data from the MeerKAT MIGHTEE survey finding 47 detections. After filtering for AGN (via X-ray detections, hot mid-infrared dust and extended radio emission), as well as blended sources, we obtained a sample of SFGs comprising: 11 cataloged radio detections, 18 non-cataloged detections (at ~3-5sigma) and 298 undetected sources. Stacking the 298 undetected sources we obtain a 3.3sigma detection in the radio. This sample, along with a local sample of Paschen-alpha emitters, lies along previous radio luminosity/SFR relations from local (z<0.2) to high redshift (z~1). Fitting the FRESCO data at 1.0<=z<=1.8 we find log(L_1.4GHz) = (1.31+/-0.17) x log(SFR_Pa-alpha) + (21.36+/-0.17) which is consistent with other literature relations. We can explain some of the observed scatter in the L_1.4GHz/SFR_Pa-alpha correlation by a toy model in which the synchrotron emission is a delayed/averaged tracer of the instantaneous Paschen-alpha SFR by ~10/75 Myr."}

We call this setup as `enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' and promote it to be local. As long as this enhanced $B-L$ gauge symmetry remains unbroken, neutrinos stay chiral and massless at low energies. Nonzero neutrino masses then require sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking order parameters, which we associate with gravity-induced neutrino condensate. If the enhancement is large and the $B-L$ gauge boson $A'$ is lighter than the heaviest neutrino, then the neutrino decay into $A'$ directly constrains the gauge coupling, which can be significantly stronger than the baryon-based fifth-force tests. Through kinetic mixing with the photon, $A'$ can also mediate neutrino-electron and coherent neutrino-nucleus scatterings, leading to possible signatures in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors."}

All loop integrals are evaluated analytically without approximations. Radiative and chiral recoil contributions of the proton are included, retaining kinematical and dynamical TPE corrections to the cross section through next-to-next-to-leading order [i.e., ${\\mathcal O}(α/M^2)$] accuracy in the recoil expansion where $M$ is the proton mass.

Such effects were entirely absent at this accuracy in our earlier analysis based on the soft-photon approximation.

While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena."}

Previous PCA-based studies of NGC 1068 reported that physically meaningful structures are mainly captured up to the second component. In contrast, our framework can interpret physically meaningful features up to the fourth component. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from our framework with molecular column densities derived from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we suggest that the abundance of HCO+ is relatively enhanced in the molecular outflow region extending to a radius of about 400 pc from the galactic center, likely due to the effects of ultraviolet radiation and highly dense gas. These results show that our framework can provide data-driven insights into physical and chemical features that have not been clearly identified in previous studies.

This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $ω\\propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks.

However, the same can not be said for mergers. It is telling that we indirectly know hierarchical assembly through mergers is one of the most crucial processes that shape our Universe, but the robust observational measurement of mergers is almost non-existent outside of the local Universe - let alone how these mergers impact galaxy properties.

A peculiar feature of the complex $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $η$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $Δ=(d-2+η)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n>1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points."}

We investigate its effects on the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using the fiducial lens (position tracer) sample MagLim++. Magnification bias is parameterized by a coefficient that describes the response of the number of selected objects per unlensed area element to a change in the lensing convergence. We quantify this coefficient using the Balrog synthetic source injection catalog to account for the complexity of the selection function, and compare these results with simplified estimates. The resulting values of the magnification coefficients for each redshift bin are [3.16 $\\pm$ 0.08, 2.76 $\\pm$ 0.21, 4.09 $\\pm$ 0.15, 4.42 $\\pm$ 0.16, 4.90 $\\pm$ 0.29, 4.83 $\\pm$ 0.25]. Relative to Year 3, this analysis provides more precise and accurate magnification bias estimates through a larger Balrog area and reweighting to better match the data properties. The cosmological results are robust when tested against various magnification parameter prior choices and also when adding cross-clustering between lens redshift bins. Neglecting magnification, however, introduces significant systematic shifts: relative to the fiducial analysis with Gaussian priors centered on the Balrog-derived estimates, we observe shifts of 1.37$σ$ in $S_8$ and -0.84$σ$ in $Ω_m$ (with cosmic shear included: -0.61$σ$ in $S_8$ and -0.71$σ$ in $Ω_m$), in agreement with findings from simulated data, demonstrating that magnification must be modeled to avoid biases. Freeing the magnification bias in lens bin 2 leads to unphysical negative values, further justifying its exclusion from the fiducial Year 6 analysis."}

One possible mechanism for triggering these starbursts is mergers and interactions, but detecting these at high redshift remains a challenge. Observations of high-redshift gravitationally lensed galaxies enable studies of the interstellar medium and environment of these extreme starbursts in detail. We used high angular resolution observations of dust continuum, CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and H2O+(202-111) emission to constrain the ongoing processes in the z = 3.63 gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxy H-ATLAS J083051.0+013224 (G09v1.97). We used PyAutoLens to create a de-magnified source plane CO(6-5) emission line cube and performed kinematic modeling using 3DBarolo. Additionally, we investigated the properties of the continuum and molecular line emission in the source plane. We find that the regions of CO(6-5) and H2O(211-202) emission match closely in the source plane but that the dust continuum emission is more compact. We find that our lens modeling results do not require more than one source, contrary to what has been found in previous studies. Instead, we find that G09v1.97 resembles a rotating disk with Vmax/sigma = 2.8 +/- 0.4 with evidence for residual emission indicative of non-circular motions such as outflows, tidal tails, or an additional background galaxy. We suggest that the origin of the non-circular motions may be associated with a bi-conical outflow, a tidal tail from an interaction, or indicate the possible presence of an additional galaxy. We calculate the dynamical mass, gas mass, star-formation rate, and depletion time for G09v1.97 and find a high star-formation rate and low gas depletion time. In combination, this suggests that G09v1.97 has recently undergone an interaction, triggering intense star formation, and is in the process of settling into a disk."}

The renormalization of the metric tensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetries -thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-N_c corrections- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in the coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. This is done through a model with two fit parameters and one matching point. The proposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and decay constants for scalar, vector, and tensor meson families similar to their experimental counterparts. We finally study neutral and charged pion form factors to show an application of the running coupling constant obtained."}

At low mass levels these constraints, together with spin truncation, fix the full five-point partial-wave data in terms of the four-point coefficients and imply simple compatibility conditions; remarkably, imposing two independent splitting loci also forces the residue to vanish on their intersection, making the associated hidden zero manifest in partial-wave space.

By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes."}

Since normal type 1 and type 2 AGNs are known to show different polarization properties, detailed investigations of the CLAGN polarization can shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the changing-look phenomenon. We present new (spectro)polarimetric observations of two changing-look AGNs located in the core of the inclined spiral galaxies NGC 1365 and NGC 2992. Both AGNs are radio emitters, thereby enabling a comparison of their polarization to the radio jet axis, which defines the accretion disk geometry. In the case of NGC 1365, the AGN shows polarization characteristics consistent with those observed in type 1 Seyferts, in particular polarization parallel to the radio jet. This intrinsic polarization is modified by the wavelength-dependent dichroic extinction that occurs in the galaxy bar and that rotates the polarization angle at the shortest wavelengths. NGC 2992, on the other hand, is so inclined that dichroic dust extinction in the disk completely dominates the polarization of the AGN, thus overwhelming any polarization due to scattering. Consequently, the polarization properties remain essentially constant between the different AGN states, and the faint broad lines observed in the polarized flux are most likely not scattered light. Differential dilution between the continuum and the narrow-line polarizations can explain the unusually high polarization measured in the emission lines."}

We then use this setup to test whether the brane worldvolume theory decouples from the bulk. Modes localised near the branes, deep in the AdS throat, are found to be infinitely redshifted with respect to asymptotic observers. Moreover, an analysis of graviton fluctuations shows the presence of an infinite potential barrier near the branes, providing a direct indication of decoupling.

Recent optical continuum reverberation mapping studies have suggested potential lag variations between different epochs, offering important clues to the physical mechanisms governing variability in the vicinity of the central black hole. We present continuous intranight multi-band photometric monitoring of NGC 4395 based on three nights of observations with the Faulkes Telescope North and two nights with the Mephisto telescope. This represents the first systematic investigation of optical continuum lag stability in a robustly confirmed IMBH. By applying difference-imaging techniques to both the new observations and archival data, we significantly detect the optical inter-band lags of $\\sim$5-15 minutes, which increase monotonically with wavelength. No obvious $u$-band lag excess is observed, implying a negligible fractional contribution from diffuse continuum (DC) emission to the optical continuum, in agreement with our spectral decomposition results. Remarkably, the inter-band lags remain stable over multi-year baselines. We attribute this long-term lag stability primarily to the minor DC contribution, a relatively steady disk-corona structure, and the unusually high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio characteristic of low-luminosity AGNs, which likely allows X-ray reprocessing to dominate over other potential variability mechanisms. Future facilities like Gemini/SCORPIO, with its simultaneous optical-to-near-infrared coverage, will be ideally suited to play an important role in advancing this field."}

Using our new DESI-independent DES BAO likelihood instead, we find a smaller increase in the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM, from 3.7$σ$ to 3.8$σ$ when using DESI DR1 BAO, and from 4.0$σ$ to 4.1$σ$ when updating to the more recent DESI DR2 BAO.

The turbulent timescale on the largest spatial scale has been found to be ~500 Myr . This together with the large spatial scale of~ 6.4 kpc suggest a large scale generating mechanism (such as tidal interaction or merger) that lasted for ~500 Myr. On the other hand, the outflowing wind is much younger and is probably the result of the intense star formation. Therefore, could it be that the star formation drives also turbulence on small scales? In the present work we utilize multi-point second order structure functions to find whether there exists also a small scale turbulence in this galaxy, and if so, try to identify its drivers. We obtained evidence for small scale turbulence whose largest spatial scale ~240 pc for the nebular gas velocity field and ~ 290 pc$ for the outflowing wind velocity field. These values suggest that stellar sub clumps or giant star clusters with an high concentration of young massive stars could be responsible for both the outflow and for the small scale turbulence."}

Such a phase appears to be in tension with a state counting interpretation of the partition function and its relation to the de Sitter entropy. It has been recently argued that the phase associated with the gravitational path integral can be cancelled by including the contribution of an observer. In this note, we compute the total phase of Vasiliev higher spin gravity on the sphere by summing over the contributions of all spins. We evaluate the resulting infinite sum using two different regularization schemes, obtaining consistent results. We find that for the non-minimal Vasiliev theory, which includes massless fields of all integer spins, the total phase vanishes in all dimensions. This result suggests that the sphere partition function of these theories may be consistent with a counting interpretation, without explicitly including an observer."}

A powerful way of addressing this question is using radio-continuum observations, where the radio waves are unaffected by dust and are able to reach sufficient resolution to resolve individual galaxies. We present an investigation of the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using deep radio continuum observations in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields, covering a combined area of $\\sim 4\\,\\mathrm{deg}^2$. These data enable the most accurate measurement of the evolution in the SFRD from mid-frequency radio continuum observations. We model the total RLF as the sum of evolving SFG and AGN components, negating the need for individual source classification. We find that the SFGs have systematically higher space densities at fixed luminosity than found in previous radio studies, but consistent with more recent studies with MeerKAT. We attribute this to the excellent low-surface brightness sensitivity of MeerKAT.\n  We then determine the evolution of the SFRD. Adopting the far-infrared - radio correlation results in a significantly higher the SFRD at $z > 1$, compared to combined UV and far-infrared measurements. However, using more recent relations for the correlation between star-formation rate and radio luminosity, based on full spectral energy distribution modelling, can resolve this apparent discrepancy. Thus radio observations provide a powerful method of determining the total SFRD, in the absence of dust-sensitive far-infrared data."}

Kinetic mixing $\\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $χ$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_χ$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\\!\\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($π^0,η,η',ω$), Delta-resonances ($Δ\\!\\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($ρ,ω,φ\\!\\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\\bar q\\!\\to U$ annihilation.

Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles."}

Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure.

Massive stars impact their surrounding initiating star-formation along their photo-dissociation region. Once the HII region is formed it is unclear if and how the second generation of stars impacts its aspect and evolution. Methods. We performed high spectral resolution (R ~ 23400) Ha Fabry-Perot observations in five fields covering the Galactic HII region NGC 7538 and lead profiles multi-gaussian fitting to extract the parameters as peak intensity, width and velocity. We then analyse the kinematics of the ionised gas building kinematic diagrams and second order structure functions for every field. Results. The observations reveal a general blue-shifted ionised gas flow larger than 11 km s-1 in NGC 7538, consistent with previous studies. Profiles originating from features that are dark in Ha due to extinction or from outside the region show velocity dispersion larger than the one typically found for the Warm Interstellar Medium. The analysis of kinematic diagrams and second-order structure functions reveals non-thermal motions attributed to turbulence and large-scale velocity gradients. In the direction of the HII region itself the turbulence seems to be shock-dominated, with a characteristic scale length between ~ 0.72 and 1.46 pc. In this context, we propose that the kinematics of the central part of the region could be explained by the superposition of the outflow coming from IRS1 and a wind bow shock formed ahead IRS6."}

This review develops a unified framework that connects these two domains. It is based mostly on multiple studies by the authors in the past few years. Using the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) to capture essential nonperturbative features of the QCD vacuum, we derive effective interactions for mesons, baryons, and multiquark states, construct their wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates, and boost them to the light front. The resulting light-front Hamiltonians, incorporating both perturbative and instanton-induced dynamics in the Wilsonian spirit, provide realistic nonperturbative inputs for computing PDFs, DAs, GPDs, quasi-distributions, and gravitational form factors at a well-defined low scale. The connection to perturbative QCD is then established by matching gradient-flow-renormalized operators and LF wave functions to the standard $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme. Perturbative DGLAP and ERBL evolution then connects these predictions to experimentally accessible regimes. % This approach is applied to quarkonia, glueballs, light mesons, baryons, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and higher multiquark hadrons, yielding consistent descriptions of both their spectra and partonic structure. Special emphasis is placed on the energy-momentum tensor and the mechanical properties of hadrons, which emerge naturally from the same dynamical ingredients. Overall, the framework demonstrates a clear continuity between hadronic spectroscopy and partonic observables, offering a coherent multiscale picture of hadron structure rooted in the underlying dynamics of QCD."}

We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again.

However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised."}

We give particular attention to the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We confirm that the recently found kite diagrams are crucial for the outcome of the analysis. Moreover, their use also mitigates the dependence of the results on the scale and scheme choice of the masses in the loop diagrams. We furthermore point out that, already at the current level of experimental precision, the Barr-Zee diagrams with charm quark loops must be taken into account. The combined use of kite diagrams and ML techniques allows for the resurrection of large fermion CP-odd couplings for Type-II and Flipped C2HDM when the 125 GeV Higgs coincides with the second lightest neutral scalar. This arises due to cancellations, typically of the per-mil order, which, moreover, will still be possible for a foreseeable eEDM precision down to $10^{-33}$ e.cm.

In this work, we test whether the observed correlation between millimeter ($\\sim200,\\mathrm{GHz}$) and hard X-ray (14 - 150,keV) luminosities can be used to plausibly identify hidden AGN in local (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, including systems hosting confirmed dual AGN. We identify three sources -- one confirmed AGN and two strong candidates -- presenting significant evidence of AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN lie within $\\sim3σ$ of the mm--X-ray correlation, suggesting this relation can be used to identify hidden pairs. By combining the position of each source relative to this correlation with independent star formation rate constraints, we propose a method to disentangle AGN and star formation contributions for sources with measured column densities. While our analysis is based on a small, heterogeneous local sample and relies on empirical scaling relations, these results indicate that millimeter continuum emission may provide a useful complementary diagnostic for obscured SMBH growth.

Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case."}

We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($λ$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z < 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\\mathcal{R}$.

Moreover, we find that in COLIBRE about $50$ per cent of BH mass growth at high redshift occurs in the super-Eddington regime, even though such events are extremely rare in time. Our work highlights the important role of super-Eddington accretion in simulations of galaxy formation for reproducing the observed early emergence of quenching of massive galaxies."}

In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena."}

The size of the domain is estimated according to the conditions of its survival in baryon surrounding, and the process of annihilation at its border is taken into account."}

II. Implications for the evolutionary paths between star-forming and passive galaxies", "comment": "Accepted by A&A", "summary": "The baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies links the total baryonic mass (stars plus gas) to the baryonic half-mass radius. In the first paper of this series, we showed that star-forming galaxies from the SPARC sample follow two distinct relations in the baryonic mass-size plane: one defined by high-surface-density (HSD), star-dominated, Sa-to-Sc galaxies, and one defined by low-surface-density (LSD), gas-dominated, Sd-to-dI galaxies. In this second paper, we study the structural relations between baryonic mass, half-mass radius, and mean surface density to constrain possible morphological transformations between star-forming and passive galaxies. We complemented the SPARC sample with $\\sim$1200 passive galaxies that are nearly devoid of gas: ellipticals (Es), lenticulars (S0s), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) or dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and the so-called `ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs). Our results can be summarised as follows: (1) passive stellar components follow four distinct relations at high statistical significance, namely (i) ellipticals plus bulges, (ii) S0 disks, (iii) non-nucleated dwarfs (dEs, dSphs, UDGs), and (iv) nucleated dEs; (2) star-forming HSD disks (mostly Sa to Sc) overlap with S0 disks within 2$σ$ in the baryonic relations and within 1$σ$ in the stellar ones, so present-day spirals may simply evolve into lenticulars as they run out of gas; (3) star-forming LSD disks (mostly Sd to dI) are offset from non-nucleated passive dwarfs at more than 3$σ$ in the baryonic relations, but the two galaxy populations overlap within 1$σ$ in the stellar relations, suggesting that non-nucleated passive dwarfs may form from star-forming dwarfs only after gas removal; (4) UDGs extend the sequence of non-nucleated dEs/dSphs and may originate from the most diffuse star-forming LSD galaxies with no need for a substantial expansion of the stellar component."}

In its original form, however, it is in tension with current observational constraints. Here we instead consider a setup in which a standard inflaton drives the background evolution, while excitations of a ghost condensate act as spectator fields that interact with the inflaton. This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $ω\\propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks. Finally, we derive the differential equations governing cosmological correlators in the ghost-collider setup. Their structure reflects the quadratic momentum dependence of the dispersion relation and distinguishes this scenario from conventional relativistic cases."}

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$."}

From the mean parallaxes of these members, we determine astrometric distances ranging from approximately 3.40 kpc for Berkeley 17 to 5.80 kpc for Berkeley 18. Isochrone fitting applied to the decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams constrains the cluster ages to 9.12 +/- 1.00 Gyr, 3.36 +/- 0.50 Gyr, and 5.10 +/- 0.50 Gyr, respectively. Interstellar reddening spans a wide range, from E(B-V) = 0.17 mag in Berkeley 39 to 0.58 mag in Berkeley 17. Structural parameters derived from King model fits to the radial density profiles, combined with mass function analyses, indicate that the clusters are dynamically relaxed systems with mass distributions broadly consistent with the canonical Salpeter slope.

This signal can be widely interpreted as originating from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Current PTA analyses primarily constrain the SGWB power spectrum and its auto-angular power spectrum. However, the supermassive black holes will produce an underlying correlation with the large-scale structure of the Universe, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of the binaries. In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_\\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_{\\ell=8} < 0.0083$ at $95\\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation."}

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes."}

At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $η/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T>T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $ζ/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied."}

As an application, we express five-point splitting constraints - the reduction of the five-point amplitude to products of four-point amplitudes on special kinematic loci - as linear relations among the five-point partial-wave coefficients. At low mass levels these constraints, together with spin truncation, fix the full five-point partial-wave data in terms of the four-point coefficients and imply simple compatibility conditions; remarkably, imposing two independent splitting loci also forces the residue to vanish on their intersection, making the associated hidden zero manifest in partial-wave space. We also show that once both channels allow spin-2 exchange a genuine kernel can remain, indicating the need for additional higher-point input to achieve complete rigidity."}
