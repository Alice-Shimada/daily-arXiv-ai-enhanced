Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in\ncompact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy\nmergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be\ndisky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using\nSDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for\n131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets)\nidentified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived s\\'ersic indices, luminosities,\nmasses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical,\nwith s\\'ersic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are\nelliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies.\nOnly $\\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span\n$1.5\\times10^9$ to $1.4\\times10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, with the most massive systems\nbeing ellipticals.

We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nmass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total\nradiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating\nthe accretion disk SEDs from 1$\\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\\circ$--$90^\\circ$\ninclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding\ndouble-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of\nvisible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting\nbolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but\nonly weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks\npeaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield\nhotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the\nvisible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly\nisotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100\\AA-3000\\AA)\nshow strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend\nstrongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\\sim$1450\\AA),\nparameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for\nestimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though\ndependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our\nSEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1\nAGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by\nthe host galaxy and torus are required in many cases."}

Using\na sample of 23 simulated galaxies from the Auriga project, we analysed the\nevolution of heavy elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. To study the\nchemical evolution of the stellar halo, bulge, and warm and cold discs of the\nmodel galaxies, we applied a decomposition method to characterise the\ndistribution of chemical elements at $z=0$ and traced back their origin. Our\nfindings indicate that each stellar component has a distinctive chemical trend\ndespite galaxy-to-galaxy variations. Specifically, stellar haloes are\n$\\alpha$-enhanced relative to other components, representing the oldest\npopulations, with [Fe/H] ~ $-$0.6 and a high fraction of ex situ stars of ~\n50%. They are followed by the warm ([Fe/H] ~ $-$0.1) and cold ([Fe/H] ~ 0)\ndiscs, with in situ fractions of ~ 90% and ~ 95%, respectively. Alternatively,\nbulges are mainly formed in situ but host more diverse stellar populations,\nwith [Fe/H] abundance extending over ~ 1 dex around the solar value. We\nconclude that one of the main drivers shaping the chemical properties of the\ngalactic components in our simulations is the age-metallicity relation. The\nbulges are the least homogeneous component of the sample, as they present\ndifferent levels of contribution from young stars in addition to the old\nstellar component.

Finally, we find that a significant fraction of stars in the warm discs\nwere in the cold disc at birth.

Here, we combine multi-band HST\nimaging data with deep long-slit SALT/RSS and integral-field VLT/MUSE spectral\ndata to study the stellar and ionized gas components of UGCA 320. Our imaging\ndata analysis reveals a very blue (V-I~0.1 mag), flattened radial colour\nprofile. We detect an abundance of ionized gas in UGCA 320 powered mostly by\nrecent star formation. The stellar disc in UGCA 320 is populated predominantly\nby young (~120 Myr) and metal-poor (~15-30 per cent solar metallicity) stars\nand it rotates in the same sense as the ionized gas disc but with higher\nrotation velocities, and possibly in different planes. Our analysis reveals a\nsharp transition in the kinematic properties of the discs at radius ~10\" (~0.3\nkpc) and distortions in the outer disc region. We show that these features are\nconsistent with a recent tidal interaction most likely with its close neighbour\n- UGCA 319. We discuss our results in the context of interacting dwarf galaxies\nand also show that similar inferences can be made independently from the\nlong-slit data analysis as with the integral-field data."}
