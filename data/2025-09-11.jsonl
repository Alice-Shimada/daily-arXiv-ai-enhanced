High energy partons\nwithin jets can trigger these high-momentum exchanges, making jets valuable\nprobes for revealing the presence of such quasi-particles.

Existing criteria, such as\nmonitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable,\nbut they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability\ntest based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the\ngradient and Hessian of the complex action.

While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method\nis readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where\nscalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is\ntied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring\ncan also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables.

We present a novel view of the\n$z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust\ncontinuum and [CII]158$\\mu$m line observations.

We\nconsider the lowest-order effective operators for scalar and fermion dark\nmatter, and derive limits on the energy scale using the recent CTAO projected\nsensitivity. Putting our findings into perspective with existing limits from\ndirect and indirect detection experiments, we conclude that CTAO will either\nplay a complementary role or be a discovery channel for dark matter signals."}

Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass\nfunction is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations\nand galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the\ncharacteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass\nproxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both\ncatalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce\nsignificant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore\nmeasurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a\nset of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them.

We investigate all possible deformations of the Standard\nModel that produce quadratic growth with energy of the four-fermion scattering\namplitudes at the muon collider, and we derive sensitivity projections.\nElectroweak radiation emission gives access to new observable final states like\nfor instance the production of a charged pair of fermions by the emission of at\nleast one $W$ boson. This, combined with jet flavor tagging, improves the\nsensitivity and the ability to disentangle different interactions. Currently,\nthe best probes of flavor-breaking new physics are high-intensity low-energy\nmeasurements of lepton or hadron decays or oscillations. The high-energy probes\nof the same interactions at the muon collider are often competitive with\ncurrent bounds and strongly superior for some class of transitions.

Most WISSH QSOs with intrinsic absorption\nestimates show little to no obscuration ($N_H \\le 5\\times 10^{22}\\,cm^{-2}$).\nAmong the obscured sources we find blue QSOs without broad absorption lines\nwithin the \"forbidden region\" of the $Log(N_H)-Log(\\lambda_{Edd})$ plane,\ntypically occupied by dust-reddened QSOs and associated with intense feedback.\nWe confirm a correlation between $L_{2-10\\,keV}$ and CIV line blueshift, a\ntracer of nuclear ionized outflows. Multi-wavelength data and complete X-ray\ncoverage enabled the investigation of the disk-corona interplay at the highest\nluminosity regimes. The broad distribution of bolometric correction and X-ray -\nto - optical index suggest caution when using $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\\,\\r{A}}$ or\n$L_{6\\,\\mu m}$ as direct X-ray proxy for individual luminous QSOs."}

It may seem like a chimera with a projected cost in\nexcess of 100 billion\\$, and counting, dispensed on ARTEMIS with little to show\nto date. However it is the ideal site for the largest telescopes that we can\ndream about, at wavelengths spanning decimetric radio through optical to\nterahertz FIR. And it is these future telescopes that will penetrate the\nfundamental mysteries of the first hydrogen clouds, the first stars, the first\ngalaxies, the first supermassive black holes, and the nearest habitable\nexoplanets. Nor does it stop there. Our lunar telescopes will take us back to\nthe first months of the Universe, and even back to the first 10$^{-36}$ second\nafter the Big Bang when inflation most likely occurred. Our lunar telescopes\nwill provide high resolution images of exoplanets that are nearby Earth-like\n'twins' and provide an unrivalled attempt to answer the ultimate cosmic\nquestion of whether we are alone in the universe. Here I will set out my vision\nof the case for lunar astronomy over the next several decades."}

In this work, we\nintroduce Krylov complexity as a sensitive diagnostic for the QME. We show that\nKrylov spread complexity encodes the asymmetry essential to the effect, and we\ndefine a new class of projective (a)symmetric complexities that sharpen this\nconnection. Strikingly, the structure of these projective complexities at the\ninitial moment ($t=0$) already carries predictive power for the onset of\nMpemba-like inversions, obviating the need for explicit time evolution. Our\nresults suggest that the geometry of states in Krylov space captures deep\ninformation about non-monotonic relaxation and provides a powerful framework\nfor diagnosing and anticipating anomalous thermalization phenomena in quantum\nsystems."}

Upon perturbation, black holes emit a\nspectrum of damped sinusoids with specific, complex frequencies. Our analysis\nof the post-merger signal shows that at least two quasi-normal modes are\nrequired to explain the data, with the most damped remaining statistically\nsignificant for about one cycle. We probe the remnant's Kerr nature by\nconstraining the spectroscopic pattern of the dominant quadrupolar ($\\ell = m =\n2$) mode and its first overtone to match the Kerr prediction to tens of percent\nat multiple post-peak times. The measured mode amplitudes and phases agree with\na numerical-relativity simulation having parameters close to GW250114. By\nfitting a parameterized waveform that incorporates the full\ninspiral-merger-ringdown sequence, we constrain the fundamental $(\\ell=m=4)$\nmode to tens of percent and bound the quadrupolar frequency to within a few\npercent of the GR prediction. We perform a suite of tests -- spanning inspiral,\nmerger, and ringdown -- finding constraints that are comparable to, and in some\ncases 2-3 times more stringent than those obtained by combining dozens of\nevents in the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. These results\nconstitute the most stringent single-event verification of GR and the Kerr\nnature of black holes to date, and outline the power of black-hole spectroscopy\nfor future gravitational-wave observations."}

Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors\n($0.5 < \\mathrm{W2} - \\mathrm{W3} < 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of\nelliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\\mathrm{W1}$ color and\nphotometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination. This conservative\nselection yields 68 new lens candidates. We then performed SED fitting with\nCIGALE across UV to submillimeter wavelengths to estimate the physical\nproperties of both the lenses and the background SMGs, and to assess the\nlensing nature of these candidates. Despite the uncertainties, we were able to\nconstrain key parameters such as stellar and dust masses, infrared\nluminosities, and star formation rates. In addition, the estimated\nmagnifications for most candidates are modest, consistent with the weak lensing\nregime ($\\mu \\simeq 1{-}1.5$), although a few sources may require more precise\nmodeling. Future efforts could refine this methodology to recover potential\ncandidates outside our selection, and high-resolution follow-up observations\nwill be essential to confirm the lensing nature of these sources and to further\ninvestigate their physical properties."}

We present 1) a series\nof pixel-based source reconstructions for cluster mass models exploring the\nrange of uncertainties in our fiducial model, 2) a similar analysis done using\na prototype \\textit{python} de-lensing code for cluster mass models from each\nof the Hubble Frontier Fields modeling teams, 3) an optimized model with\npixel-based source reconstructions, and 4) and an investigation of how our\noptimized model affects the cluster mass model locally and globally in the\nhighest-magnification regions.

A key discriminant between the two models would\nbe the existence of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs), which can only\nbe produced through turbulent re-acceleration.

Existing criteria, such as\nmonitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable,\nbut they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability\ntest based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the\ngradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this\nestimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a\nphysically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the\nestimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use\none-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the\nestimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and\nincomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method\nis readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where\nscalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is\ntied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring\ncan also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables.

In the present\npaper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a\nsimple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black\nhole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the\nevaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously\nbroken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions.

Here we report a high\ndetection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows\ntraced by [O III] emission in z $\\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$\nand order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\\sim$260% the\nobserved quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\\gtrsim$6.6 times\nlarger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\\sim$ 1.5-3.5\n(0/58) and z $<$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even\nfaster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\\lesssim$ 3, and\ncould reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium\n(IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is\n$\\sim$230$\\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher\nfrequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative\nfeedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a\nsignificant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies."}

However, the continuum emission from their\nhighly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with\nvery inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects,\nlike the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of\nstrong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and\nstrongly time-varying ''illuminator'', the hot plasma emission extends all the\nway to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed\nradiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the\nISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from\naccretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes\nthe spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the\nextended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral\nphase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator,\ntypically found at $r\\sim (10^2-10^4)\\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can\nprovide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more\ninformation on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we\nexamine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning\nstrong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the\nfact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the\nform of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and\nits spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass,\nwhile the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the\nSMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime."}

For a massive field, we show that this correction is not captured by\nJT gravity coupled to matter: it requires a backreaction of the metric field.\nFor a massless field, the correction is controlled solely by the dilaton and\nhence is model-independent. We compare our findings with correlation functions\non BTZ and find perfect agreement. We use our results to quantify the\ncorrections for a class of correlators relevant to five- and four-dimensional\nblack holes.

By now, various aspects of this universality have been\nunderstood and demonstrated in a number of explicit examples. In the present\npaper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a\nsimple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black\nhole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the\nevaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously\nbroken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions. We show that the decay\nrate as well as the characteristic energy of the emitted quanta are given by\nthe inverse size of the object, in striking similarity with the Hawking\nevaporation of a black hole. The time-scale of information retrieval also\nmatches the one previously suggested for a black hole by Page. We give the\nsemiclassical derivation of the phenomenon as well as its fully quantum\nresolution as a decaying coherent state of Goldstone bosons. The universal\nnature of the effect and its microscopic understanding support the analogous\nquantum portrait of a black hole as a saturated coherent state of gravitons."}
