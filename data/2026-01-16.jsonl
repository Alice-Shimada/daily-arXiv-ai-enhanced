Comments welcome!", "summary": "JWST's \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the \"X-Ray Dot\" (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 6400\\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\\rm FWHM \\sim 2700-3200\\,km\\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L_\\textrm{2$-$10$\\,$keV} = 10^{44.18}\\,$erg$\\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray--torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties."}

Expanding samples of DSFGs with [O$_{\\rm \\,III}$] emission will be key to place this heterogeneous, poorly-understood galactic phase in its astrophysical context."}

Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery."}

As systems hosting most of the baryonic mass in the local Universe, they preserve imprints of the quenching mechanisms in the early Universe. We exploited the large BOSS and DESI spectroscopic datasets to perform the first homogeneous and continuous mapping of the evolution of stellar population properties of a complete sample of the most massive LRGs ($\\log (M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})> 11.5$) at 0.15 < z < 0.8. By consistently fitting the same spectral indices at all redshifts, we measured trends of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and light-weighted age as a function of redshift. These galaxies exhibit a passive light-weighted age evolution and flat [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] trends towards lower redshift, indicating genuinely passive evolution. These trends are robust against the choice of stellar population models and analysis assumptions, and they support the predictions from IllustrisTNG, which predict negligible chemical evolution for the most massive quenched systems at z < 0.8. Our results suggest that, despite nearly 5 Gyr of cosmic time and a 3-4x increase in number density, the stellar population properties of massive quiescent galaxies remain essentially unchanged since z ~ 0.8. This shows a negligible progenitor bias below z ~ 0.8, and a genuinely passive evolution. Newly added systems after $z \\sim 0.8$ were already largely quenched and chemically mature, while subsequent evolution was dominated by dry mergers without altering the bulk of the stellar populations."}

To ensure that such signals, expected to be exceedingly weak, can be detected in the ongoing O4 observing run by coherent integration over years, simulated waveforms ('hardware injections') are injected directly into the LIGO data by continuously modulating the positions of the interferometer mirrors so as to mimic nearly sinusoidal signals from fast-spinning galactic neutron stars. A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream."}

However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \\,$M$_{\\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems."}

This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what \"understanding\" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will \"derive fundamental physics\" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose \"pragmatic understanding\" as a framework for integration--recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it."}

In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in the regime where the dark-energy scalar field undergoes coherent oscillations about the minimum of its potential. We show that the standard effective fluid description breaks down in this phase and develop a consistent field-based perturbation framework, which we use to assess the impact of oscillatory dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures."}

Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk."}

We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $α$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way."}

Here, we compute the \\textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$ν$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings.

The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times."}

Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (>= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z < 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope."}

We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed."}

We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\\sim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\\mathrm{TeV}$ scale."}

We find indications of a non-zero intrinsic alignment signal in the higher redshift bins, while in the lower bins our results look more uncertain. We believe this is caused by known issues with the individual galaxies photo-z estimation. This effect is particularly harmful for the self-calibration method, since it has high requirements for reliable estimation of the photo-$z$s, and the need for individual galaxy point estimates and tomographic binning to match.

To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour.

However, central/satellite assignments and isolation labels can vary across group catalogs, and such misclassifications can strongly bias physical interpretations. We present a uniform, physically motivated reassessment of the environments of 155 RQEs previously identified as centrals in an SDSS-based group catalog. We construct value-added neighbor catalogs via KD-tree searches and apply consistent thresholds in projected separation and line-of-sight velocity to (i) verify centrality, (ii) quantify isolation using a mass-ratio-based companion criterion, and (iii) identify potential pseudo-centrals via proximity to massive clusters. We find that 132/155 (85.2\\%) RQEs remain true centrals, while 23/155 (14.8\\%) are better interpreted as misidentified centrals with a more massive neighbor within $R_{\\rm proj}\\leq0.8$~Mpc and $ΔV\\leq250$~km~s$^{-1}$. Among the true centrals, 110/132 (83.3\\%) satisfy our isolation criterion, and only one system meets our pseudo-central definition, indicating that direct cluster-scale preprocessing is rare for RQE centrals. Using projected number density and surface stellar mass density, we show that misidentified and non-isolated systems occupy systematically denser regimes than isolated true centrals. These results imply that while most RQEs ($\\sim$71\\%) are consistent with predominantly internal quenching in genuinely isolated centrals, a non-negligible minority ($\\sim$29\\%) likely experienced environmentally influenced pathways at group scales."}

Data available at https://www.cosmoglobe.uio.no/products/cosmoglobe-dr2.html", "summary": "We present a four-component high-resolution model of thermal dust emission for microwave and sub-mm frequencies derived from Planck HFI, WHAM and Gaia. The resulting high-resolution model derived here forms the basis for the thermal dust model employed in the Cosmoglobe DR2 reanalysis of COBE-DIRBE. The four dust components are called ``cold dust'', ``hot dust'', ``nearby dust'', and ``Ha correlated dust'', respectively, and trace different physical environments. The spatial distributions of the nearby dust and Ha dust components are defined by the Edenhofer et al. Gaia 3D extinction model and the WHAM survey, respectively, while the hot and cold dust components are fit freely pixel-by-pixel to the Planck HFI data. We use a global parameter grid search coupled to an amplitude map Gibbs sampler to fit this model to Planck HFI data. In agreement with the companion low-resolution analysis, we find that the hot dust component is strongly correlated with the FIRAS Cii map, while the cold dust component is strongly correlated with the HI4PI Hi map. Despite its fewer degrees of freedom per pixel compared to the Planck 2015 legacy dust model, we find that this new model performs competitively in terms of overall residuals, capturing over 98% of the full-sky dust variance for all channels. When fitting a spatially varying 3-parameter MBB model to the new dust model with isotropic SEDs, we find very similar spatial distributions to those of the official Planck analysis, and this new model thus represents an economical decomposition of previously published spatially varying spectral parameter maps. We conclude that this new model represents both a statistically more efficient summary of thermal dust in the microwave and far-infrared regimes and a physically more realistic decomposition of the sky compared to the traditional 3-parameter MBB model.

The K-matrix is a powerful, yet comparatively simple, method to describe scattering amplitudes, including coupled-channel effects, with the aim to interpret experimental data. Throughout the literature, a range of dispersive and nondispersive K-matrix methods are employed. Here, we compare the dispersive and nondispersive formulations in the context of the N/D method. It is shown that the methods are equivalent in the physical region under K-matrix reparameterization. Differences away from the physical region are examined. Applications to synthetic data are used to illustrate the effects of model choices concerning form factors and the application of dispersion relations, with the goal of clarifying best practices. We find no clear preference with regards to dispersive modeling. In contrast, we find that interpretational ambiguity of the bare model parameters -- and even of the form of the bare model -- is endemic, and recommend a thorough sampling of data and model spaces to assess conclusion robustness."}

At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files. This establishes that all possible four-point gravitational interactions can be factorized into products of gauge-theory building blocks governed by this universal notion of color-kinematics duality."}

We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star."}

Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z>5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation."}

We analyze two realizations: (i) Case A: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+βρ_m^{n}+γ$, where $γ$ acts as a vacuum term, and (ii) Case B: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+βρ_m+γρ_m^{n}$, where the nonlinear sector can mimic dark energy without an explicit cosmological constant. For each case, we construct a bounded autonomous system, classify all critical points and their stability, and compute cosmographic diagnostics. The phase-space analysis shows that Case A reproduces the standard radiation$\\to$matter$\\to$de~Sitter sequence only for $n\\gtrsim 4/5$, with acceleration essentially enforced by the vacuum term.

However, this time we find that these wormholes do dominate our path integral for the relevant connected partition function. This supports the suggestion by Garcia-Garcia and Godet that contributions from such wormholes parallel the physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at complex couplings.

The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $α$ and the KR field parameter $\\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field.

We find that in both of the above lensed systems, the complex image morphology cannot be reproduced by simple fold/cusp caustics, and detailed lens modeling reveals higher-order swallowtail caustic configurations. In the $z=2.91$ lens system, a small part of the source galaxy (which itself is part of a galaxy group) containing atleast two compact knots sits inside the swallowtail caustic, producing a quadruply imaged arc. At two of the image positions of these knots, we infer point source magnifications of $\\gtrsim 300$, implying lensing-corrected effective radii of $\\lesssim 0.8-1.5$ pc. The $z=6.70$ system exhibits even more complex image formation. We therefore only use the most confidently identified counter-images of knots in this system as constraints in our lens modeling. The resulting model predicts magnifications $\\sim20-200$ and lensing-corrected effective radii of $\\lesssim 0.8-18.5$ pc for various knots. Together, these two systems represent the first example of observations of multiple swallowtail image formations in a single galaxy cluster and demonstrate the ability of swallowtail caustics to magnify individual substructures at sub-parsec scales, from intermediate redshifts to the first billion years of the Universe."}

We explore the behaviors of specific bulk viscosity ($ζ/s$) and $ζ/η$ across different QCD phase transitions, including the Mott phase transition, the chiral crossover, and the first-order transition with the associated metastable phase. The calculation shows that both $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ are extremely small at high temperatures, approaching the nature of a conformal theory. Larger $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ are derived near the chiral phase transition at finite temperature. Along the chiral crossover line, $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ generally increase with decreasing temperature, though $ζ/η$ exhibits a slight decline near the critical endpoint (CEP). On the boundary of the first-order transition, $ζ/s$ shows a non-monotonic variation with temperature.

This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter.

The physical processes responsible for jet bending, and their influence on the polarization properties of radio galaxies, remain poorly understood, leading to the question of whether jet properties in bent radio galaxies differ from those in linear radio galaxies. Using a sample of 24 polarized bent radio galaxies, observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1--2 GHz, we test for correlation of bending angle with polarization parameters measuring Faraday rotation, intrinsic fractional polarization, and Faraday rotation dispersion, used here as a measure of turbulence along the line of sight. We find no statistically significant correlations. At the spatial resolution of our dataset (3--46 kpc, median 18.4 kpc), our results indicate that we are primarily probing larger-scale intracluster medium effects not related to bending angle. The absence of a statistically significant correlation suggests that bent radio galaxies are reliable probes of intracluster magnetic fields, because their intrinsic properties do not appear to introduce systematic biases into measured polarization parameters. We do detect a preference for source magnetic field vectors to align with the direction of jet bending. Finally, we estimate that the POSSUM and SKA surveys will contain $\\gtrsim$300 and $\\gtrsim$1000 polarized radio galaxies, respectively, providing large future samples with a range of bending angles and similar redshift distribution and number of beams per source as in our sample, enabling our results to be tested with greater statistical power."}

We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed."}

To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model.

This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution."}

The model is analyzed for both linear ($Υ\\propto T$) and cubic ($Υ\\propto T^{3}$) dissipation regimes. Confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest observational data from Planck+BICEP/Keck, P-ACT-LB-BK18 and SPT, and , we find that in the weak dissipative regime ($Q_{*} \\lesssim 10^{-5}$), the scalar spectral index $n_{s} \\simeq 0.965$ lies at the boundary of the combined P-ACT-LB-BK18 constraints, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ remains within observable ranges. For stronger dissipation ($Q_{*} \\gtrsim 10^{-5}$), the model predicts values of $n_{s}$ well within the $1$--$2σ$ confidence region of all datasets, with tensor modes remaining fully observable in both dissipation scenarios. These results indicate that forthcoming CMB polarization experiments may be capable of detecting primordial gravitational waves, thereby providing a robust observational test of warm hybrid inflation across different dissipative regimes."}

In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes."}

These stars, dubbed Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, provide crucial constraints on the nature of the early universe including the earliest nucleosynthetic events. Whether these stars exist at similar rates in nearby galaxies is a major open question with implications for the environmental dependence of early chemical evolution. Here, we present the discovery of the first five CEMP stars in the Milky Way's largest dwarf companion, the LMC, using SDSS-V spectra from the BOSS instrument. We measure metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -2.1 to -3.2 and evolutionary state corrected carbon enhancements of [C/Fe] = +1.2 to +2.4, placing these stars among the most metal-poor and carbon-rich ever identified in the LMC. This discovery demonstrates that CEMP stars do exist in the LMC despite previous null detections, and establishes the foundation for measuring the CEMP occurrence rate in this system. Such measurements will provide critical tests of whether environmental differences affect the formation channels and frequencies of these ancient, carbon-rich stars."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5<z_{\\rm spec}<7.2$, by requiring broad H$α$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$α$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$α$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$α$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$α$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$α$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth."}

While upcoming oscillation experiments aim to resolve this problem at low energies, complementary approaches are highly desirable. In this Letter, we show that the neutrino mass ordering can be probed at high-energy colliders through the lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions. In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy--light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U_{\\rm tot}^2 \\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U_{\\rm tot}^2 \\gtrsim 10^{-6}$.

The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H $α$ line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\\times 10^{-17}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $0.4<z<1.8$, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives. The achieved H $α$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $α$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction. However, this approach introduces non-trivial biases that need to be accounted for when comparing to theoretical predictions. Redshift uncertainties pose the greatest challenge in recovering the expected dependence of galaxy properties, though the well-established stellar mass transverse gradients towards filaments can still be observed."}

Radiative corrections can induce controlled departures from locality in the latticed space, thereby generating suppressed but non-vanishing masses for the remaining $N_f-1$ generations. In this work, we present an explicit implementation of this mechanism to address the flavour hierarchies of the Standard Model. After delineating the minimal extensions of the gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors required for feasible implementation of the mechanism, we demonstrate that the framework successfully reproduces the observed charged-fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing pattern. We analyse the new-physics effects arising from the extended sectors and confront them with existing constraints from direct, indirect searches and precision measurements. It is shown that a viable realisation of the mechanism allows the spectrum of vectorlike fermions and additional gauge boson to lie at scales as low as $\\mathcal{O}(5)\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ with the lightest states typically corresponding to top partners. This stands in sharp contrast to conventional radiative mass-generation scenarios, in which phenomenological constraints typically impose a lower bound on the new-physics scale of order a few hundred to several thousand TeV."}

The presence of matter in the brane induces a nonsingular cosmological evolution for the scale factor of the brane world under certain conditions of mass and cosmological parameters. However, the nonsingular nature is unstable since the bounce occurs inside the Cauchy horizon. Further, we consider the shellworld or the dark bubble scenario for the same bulk spacetime. It shows stable nonsingular cosmological nature of the bubble universe under certain conditions on the bulk and bubble parameters."}

The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H $α$ line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\\times 10^{-17}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $0.4<z<1.8$, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives. The achieved H $α$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $α$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction. However, this approach introduces non-trivial biases that need to be accounted for when comparing to theoretical predictions. Redshift uncertainties pose the greatest challenge in recovering the expected dependence of galaxy properties, though the well-established stellar mass transverse gradients towards filaments can still be observed."}

Our calculation demonstrates the methodology and feasibility of performing higher order calculations in LCPT. Since in Hamiltonian perturbation theory the longitudinal $k^+$ momentum is always positive, poles in $1/k^+$ can be regularized by a simple cutoff which cancels in physical results, without any associated ambiguities. For transverse momentum integrals we use dimensional regularization. Developing methods for loop calculations in LCPT paves the way for a systematical, automatizable procedure for precision calculations in this framework with a transparent physical partonic interpretation. This can provide a standard framework in higher order calculations in the gluon saturation regime of QCD."}

The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \\simeq 69.5\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \\simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\\rm tr} \\sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $ω_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime. Conclusively, all these results along with the study of the energy conditions and stability analysis showcases the given $f(Q,L_m)$ model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology"}

Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery."}

Traditionally, this is done by collecting randomly-generated events in histograms. In this article, we explore an alternative approach, whose main idea is to approximate the target distribution by a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions whose coefficients are calculated using the Monte-Carlo integration. This method has the advantage of directly yielding smooth approximations to target distributions. Furthermore, in the context of high-order perturbative calculations with local subtractions, it eliminates the so-called bin-to-bin fluctuations, which often severely affect the quality of conventional histograms. We also demonstrate that the availability of a high-quality approximation to the target distribution, for example the leading-order result in the perturbative expansion, can be exploited to construct an optimized orthonormal basis. We compare the performance of this method to conventional histograms in both toy-model and real Monte-Carlo settings, applying it to Higgs boson production in weak boson fusion as an example."}

Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations.

This correspondence is established by matching massless amplitudes to Minimal Helicity-Chirality (MHC) amplitudes, which arise from an expansion of massive spin-spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip $mη$ order by order. The primary MHC amplitude deforms into a massless amplitude of the same helicity; if a vector boson is involved, it may instead vanish due to the associated conserved current. In cases where the primary amplitude vanishes, the leading contributions originate from descendant MHC amplitudes, each corresponding to a distinct massless amplitude in the ultraviolet theory containing either a transverse gauge boson or a Goldstone boson. We propose a systematic amplitude deformation procedure for three-point massless-massive matching based on helicity-chirality unification and the scaling properties of $mη$. Sub-leading MHC amplitudes are matched to massless amplitudes with additional on-shell Higgs splitting, a process known as on-shell Higgsing. In this work, we extend and reinterpret on-shell Higgsing as a transversality flip between different MHC states, and obtain all the 3-point massless-massive matching results in the spontaneous broken standard model."}

We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(σ) \\neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\\rm dec} = (π/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration.

Then only using the contact minimal helicity-chirality amplitudes at the leading order, we show both bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations can be utilized to compute higher-point massive amplitudes. This provides a systematic framework for constructing various higher-point electroweak amplitudes, analogous to established on-shell methods for massless theories.

At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files. This establishes that all possible four-point gravitational interactions can be factorized into products of gauge-theory building blocks governed by this universal notion of color-kinematics duality."}

Starting from the one-loop resummed gluon propagator in the imaginary-time formalism, and incorporating non-perturbative effects through a phenomenological correction to the HTL description, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity. This, in turn, leads to a complex heavy-quark potential: the real part is used to determine binding energies by solving the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation, while the imaginary part generates thermal decay widths, dominated by Landau damping. Within the explored parameter range, temperature has the greatest control over Debye screening, potential modification, and quarkonium stability, whereas finite density and weak magnetic fields introduce comparatively smaller quantitative changes. As the temperature increases, binding energies decrease and thermal widths grow, giving rise to the expected hierarchy between ground and excited states and a sequential suppression pattern in the dissociation temperatures. Overall, our results indicate that while finite chemical potential and weak magnetic fields can shift quarkonium properties in a measurable way, thermal effects remain the primary driver of dissociation, with direct relevance for heavy-ion collision phenomenology."}

Our proposal introduces a generating system for higher-spin vertices at the level of classical equations, which we refer to as irregular, in contrast to the regular case described by Vasiliev. This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $η$ or $\\barη$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $η$ and $\\barη$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $η^N \\barη^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \\leq 2$ and any $N$.

A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream."}

The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity."}

Radiative corrections can induce controlled departures from locality in the latticed space, thereby generating suppressed but non-vanishing masses for the remaining $N_f-1$ generations. In this work, we present an explicit implementation of this mechanism to address the flavour hierarchies of the Standard Model. After delineating the minimal extensions of the gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors required for feasible implementation of the mechanism, we demonstrate that the framework successfully reproduces the observed charged-fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing pattern. We analyse the new-physics effects arising from the extended sectors and confront them with existing constraints from direct, indirect searches and precision measurements. It is shown that a viable realisation of the mechanism allows the spectrum of vectorlike fermions and additional gauge boson to lie at scales as low as $\\mathcal{O}(5)\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ with the lightest states typically corresponding to top partners.

We finally discuss how this modified Friedmann equation might explain a number of puzzling cosmological observations."}

This correspondence is established by matching massless amplitudes to Minimal Helicity-Chirality (MHC) amplitudes, which arise from an expansion of massive spin-spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip $mη$ order by order. The primary MHC amplitude deforms into a massless amplitude of the same helicity; if a vector boson is involved, it may instead vanish due to the associated conserved current. In cases where the primary amplitude vanishes, the leading contributions originate from descendant MHC amplitudes, each corresponding to a distinct massless amplitude in the ultraviolet theory containing either a transverse gauge boson or a Goldstone boson. We propose a systematic amplitude deformation procedure for three-point massless-massive matching based on helicity-chirality unification and the scaling properties of $mη$. Sub-leading MHC amplitudes are matched to massless amplitudes with additional on-shell Higgs splitting, a process known as on-shell Higgsing. In this work, we extend and reinterpret on-shell Higgsing as a transversality flip between different MHC states, and obtain all the 3-point massless-massive matching results in the spontaneous broken standard model."}

The inclusion of four-point contact amplitudes is essential to maintain gauge invariance in the spontaneously broken Standard Model. We construct all the standard model massive contact amplitudes and identify the physical light-cone gauge nature of massive amplitudes. Then only using the contact minimal helicity-chirality amplitudes at the leading order, we show both bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations can be utilized to compute higher-point massive amplitudes. This provides a systematic framework for constructing various higher-point electroweak amplitudes, analogous to established on-shell methods for massless theories. Finally by deforming the gauge-invariant $n$-point amplitudes, we extend the massless-massive correspondence from three-and-four point contact amplitudes to general $n$-point factorized amplitudes."}
