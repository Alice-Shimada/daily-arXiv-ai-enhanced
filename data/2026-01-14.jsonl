On the theoretical side, ab initio lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations of hadronic vacuum polarization have made remarkable progress. They are now the new standard for studying the leading non-perturbative contributions, which have previously hindered matching with the precision required for full exploitation of the experimental results. The lattice results affected both leading hadronic contributions the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contributions by increasing the previously generally accepted $e^+e^-$ to hadrons based dispersion relation results. The shifts reduced the discrepancy between theory and experiment, leaving nothing missing. One of the most prominent signs of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has disappeared: the SM appears validated more than ever, in agreement with what other searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN tell us! A triumph of the SM, even though the SM cannot explain known cosmological puzzles like dark matter or baryogenesis, and why neutrino masses are so tiny, the absence of strong CP violation, for example. I also argue that the discrepancy between the data-driven dispersive result and the lattice QCD results for the hadronic vacuum polarization can be largely explained by correcting the $e^+e^-$ data for 'rho-gamma' mixing effects."}

This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $β$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\\langle L \\rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $σ^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$.

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories."}

Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries.

These surgery moves generate a large number of bulk manifolds that have to be included in any reasonable definition of the gravitational path integral.

These proofs rely on structure theorems of 3-manifolds, which non-trivially interact with the requirements of the statistical boundary ensemble. We illustrate the application of this procedure with many examples, such as Euclidean wormholes, twisted $I$-bundles and handlebody-knots.

In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\\gtrsim10^4 M_\\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years.

Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\\{{\\cal I}_1,{\\cal I}_2,{\\cal I}_3,\\hat g_{μν}\\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests."}

The background contamination and statistical fluctuations of typical astronomical images make this a challenging statistical task, particularly for X-ray images with low surface brightness. We develop a three-step Bayesian procedure to identify the boundaries of irregularly shaped sources. We first apply a Bayesian multiscale reconstruction algorithm known as LIRA to obtain posterior pixelwise probability distributions of the source intensity that properly account for known structures, astrophysical background, and the effect of the telescope point spread function. Next, we adopt an Ising model to group pixels with similar intensities into cohesive regions corresponding to background and source. Finally, the boundary is derived on the basis of the most likely aggregation of pixels into the source region. Because the overall model combines LIRA and the Ising model, we call it LIRA-Ising. We verify the proposed method using a set of simulation studies. We then apply it to the Chandra X-ray Observatory images of two high redshift quasars, PKS J1421-0643 and 0730+257, to determine the extent and morphology of X-ray jets.

It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding \"dressed\" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., \"edge modes\" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional \"boost supertranslation\" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any \"semiclassical state\" is the generalized entropy with an additional \"edge mode\" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized \"observer\". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the \"shape\" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state."}

We use the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(2-1) emission line in 19 fields centered on previously known high-velocity atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds associated with the outflow. Over 200 CO clumps are detected within 16 different HI clouds. These clumps have typical radii of 1 - 3 parsec, high velocity dispersions of 1 - 6 km/s and molecular gas masses ranging from a few to several hundred solar masses. Molecular clumps in the wind sit on the low-mass end of the mass - size relation of regular molecular clouds, but are far displaced from the mass (or size) - linewidth relation, being generally more turbulent and showing high internal pressures. Nearly 90% of the clumps are gravitationally unbound with virial parameters >> 10 - 100, indicating that these structures are either being disrupted or they must be confined by external pressure from the surrounding hot medium. While the observed properties of CO clumps do not seem to evolve clearly with latitude, we find that molecular gas is not detected in any of the 6 HI clouds with projected distances over 1 kpc from the Galactic Center, suggesting the existence of a maximum timescale of ~ 3 Myr for the dissociation of molecular gas within the wind. Overall, current observations in the Galactic center support a scenario in which a hot wind entrains cold gas clouds from the disk, driving their progressive transformation from molecular to atomic and ultimately ionized gas through stripping, turbulence, and dissociation."}

RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated."}

We address this in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where a natural physical clock emerges by promoting the vacuum energy to a dynamical variable: the vacuum cosmological constant becomes a top form degree of freedom conjugate to spacetime volume, thereby defining a notion of bulk physical time. This construction is naturally formulated in the Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) framework. We show that the boundary dynamics is the Schwarzian mode coupled to a free particle on $U(1)$, matching the universal low-energy effective action of the complex SYK model. By further clarifying the role of the vacuum cosmological constant as a top form, we establish the equivalence between JT gravity coupled to two-dimensional Maxwell theory and 2d HT gravity via an explicit field redefinition. The initial question is addressed: we show that the resulting boundary theory can itself be rewritten as an observer action, equivalently a $(0+1)$-dimensional HT theory. This yields a direct identification of the boundary clock with the $U(1)$ phase mode, and makes its relation to the bulk clock explicit."}

Future higher contrast systems, like the Extremely Large Telescope's Planetary Camera System, will require higher performance wavefront sensing. A further performance improvement could be achieved with a polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor by using additional information over a broader wavelength range. The development of such systems is becoming more feasible with the emergence of new detector technologies such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. These are arrays of superconductor detectors that give a position, arrival time and measure of the energy for each incident photon. This paper introduces the polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor concept by defining the technologies and techniques employed and their requirements. A method is developed to track the optical gains, taking advantage of the additional wavelength information, and used to compensate for optical gains within an optimised reconstructor to minimise noise propagation. An overview of expected performance improvement, using end-to-end simulations, is provided using the Keck II adaptive optics system as a reference design. The polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor was shown to increase the limiting magnitude by 1 to 2 magnitudes, and the contrast by factors of 1.5 to 4, versus single band pyramid wavefront sensors, by sensing over a wavelength range approximately five to ten times broader (800-1800 nm) compared to Z band (152 nm wide) and H band (300 nm wide).

We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states. The nesting property of the resulting one-parameter family of horizon subalgebras implies a generalized second law for non-stationary linearized perturbations of Killing horizons. Lastly, we use gravitational half-sided modular inclusion algebras to prove the quantum focusing conjecture in the perturbative quantum gravity regime."}

The coexistence of these two amplitudes is essential for generating nonzero CP violation (CPV) effects. Since the $λ_b$ amplitude is strongly suppressed, its experimental determination is highly challenging. However, by exploiting SU(3) flavor symmetry, which relates the well-measured Cabibbo-favored (CF) amplitudes to the SCS tree amplitudes, information on the $λ_b$ amplitude can be extracted.Using current experimental data, a conservative analysis yields $λ_b$ amplitudes can be as large as about $10\\%$ of the corresponding tree amplitudes with a significance of $2.1σ$.

To be submitted to OJA", "summary": "We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\\sim}72\\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\\sim}38\\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."}

A U-Net model is trained using a Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function on datasets of varying sizes, up to 40,000 images of size 48x48 from the COSMOS Real Galaxy Dataset. Performance is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity metrics, with the latter employed in a two-model framework to assess solution stability.\n  Results: The U-Net model demonstrates effectiveness in blind deconvolution, with performance improving consistently as the training dataset size increases, saturating beyond 5,000 images. Cosine similarity analysis reveals convergence between independently trained models, indicating stable solutions. Remarkably, the U-Net outperforms the oracle-like Tikhonov method in challenging conditions (low PSNR/medium SSIM). The model also generalizes well to unseen seeing and noise conditions, although optimal performance is achieved when training parameters include validation conditions. Experiments on synthetic $C^α$ images further support the hypothesis that the U-Net learns a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis, akin to sparse representations observed in denoising tasks.

We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data.

The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets.

Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter."}

We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing\" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 < i < 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys.

Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation.

We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31.\n  Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies.\n  Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations.\n  Conclusions.

We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with $v_{\\rm s}$ of $\\sim \\rm 100s\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size ($N_{\\rm C} \\gtrsim 200$), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H$_2$ transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with $v_{\\rm s} \\leq \\rm 10\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback."}

We then introduce experimental observables, the so called angular moments -- that probe these linear combinations of partial wave coefficients -- and can be determined from a fully differential analysis of the angular distribution of the leptons arising from the $Z$ decay. We show that analysing the dependence of these angular moments on the $Zh$ invariant mass allows us to systematically probe all higher dimension EFT operators contributing to this process.

Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\\sim$42 kpc to the north-west.

We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."}

We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\\log M_{\\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\\log M_{\\text{halo}} < 12.1 M_{\\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution."}

We demonstrate that, while the method yields spurious critical points in purely hadronic models (HRG) due to non-parabolic contour behavior at low temperatures ($T \\lesssim 120$ MeV), it accurately reproduces the CP location in frameworks that feature a genuine phase transition and benchmarked against lattice QCD, such as Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton, and Functional QCD approaches. Building on our previous determination of constant entropy contours using lattice data, we extend that analysis to construct a complete Lattice-based Equation of State (EoS) at finite density, which features a critical point at $(T, μ_B) \\approx (114, 602)$ MeV. By integrating the extrapolated entropy density with respect to temperature, we reconstruct the pressure, baryon density, susceptibility, and speed of sound in the critical region, and analyze the focusing behavior of isentropic trajectories in the vicinity of the critical point."}

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon.

Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs), which transition between classifications over time, further complicate this picture. In this work, we learn a data-driven, low-dimensional representation of multi-wavelength photometric light curves of AGNs, in which the structure of the projected manifold correlates with AGN class and independent spectroscopic properties. Using the NASA Fornax Science Platform, we assemble light curves from ZTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia, and WISE/NEOWISE for two samples: (1) a heterogeneous set of $\\sim$2000 AGNs spanning $z \\lesssim 1$, including SDSS quasars, variability-selected sources, and CLAGNs; and (2) a homogeneous sample of $\\sim$65000 narrow-line AGNs at $z \\approx 0.1$ with well-characterized optical emission-line measurements. Without using class labels during training, the learned manifolds organize variability-selected AGNs into coherent regions of the low-dimensional space, distinguish between turn-on and turn-off CLAGNs, and place tidal disruption events in distinct regions. Manifold coordinates correlate with key spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OIII] luminosity, and D$_n$(4000), demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-band variability can be combined in a purely data-driven manner to recover correlations with independent physical diagnostics, without requiring explicit physical modeling.

Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests."}

In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \\quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \\textit{a priori}.

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories."}

The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed.

In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript."}

We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson & Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters."}

However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation."}

This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $β$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\\langle L \\rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $σ^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$.

It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding \"dressed\" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., \"edge modes\" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional \"boost supertranslation\" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any \"semiclassical state\" is the generalized entropy with an additional \"edge mode\" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized \"observer\". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the \"shape\" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state."}

However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V > 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$α$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$α$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3σ$) flux variation of the broad H$α$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$α$ complex and the [SII]$λ\\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$α$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST."}

This construction is naturally formulated in the Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) framework. We show that the boundary dynamics is the Schwarzian mode coupled to a free particle on $U(1)$, matching the universal low-energy effective action of the complex SYK model. By further clarifying the role of the vacuum cosmological constant as a top form, we establish the equivalence between JT gravity coupled to two-dimensional Maxwell theory and 2d HT gravity via an explicit field redefinition. The initial question is addressed: we show that the resulting boundary theory can itself be rewritten as an observer action, equivalently a $(0+1)$-dimensional HT theory. This yields a direct identification of the boundary clock with the $U(1)$ phase mode, and makes its relation to the bulk clock explicit."}

We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing\" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 < i < 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys.

We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states. The nesting property of the resulting one-parameter family of horizon subalgebras implies a generalized second law for non-stationary linearized perturbations of Killing horizons.

In this paper we show that these difficulties arise from the abruptness of the truncation rather than from the finite extent itself. We introduce a general and infinitely differentiable radial truncation scheme that can be applied to any density profile, and illustrate its behaviour using the Hernquist model. We find that softly truncated models are dynamically consistent provided that the truncation is sufficiently gradual, and we determine the corresponding critical truncation sharpness. Their distribution functions display a characteristic bump-dip feature near the truncation energy that signals the transition between consistent and inconsistent cases. In contrast to sharply truncated models, softly truncated systems can support an extensive family of Osipkov-Merritt orbital structures, including moderately radial ones. Soft truncations therefore offer a general and physically motivated route to constructing finite-extent dynamical models with well-controlled outer-edge behaviour."}

Relating velocity structure to the cosmic web", "comment": "17 pages, 13 + 2 figures, 1 table, comments are welcome!", "summary": "Our Local Group, dominated in mass by the Milky Way (MW) and M31, provides a unique laboratory for testing $Λ$CDM cosmology on small scales owing to its proximity. However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation."}

Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity."}

We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \\texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies."}

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed."}

By matching the non-extensive $β$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum.

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts.

We then introduce experimental observables, the so called angular moments -- that probe these linear combinations of partial wave coefficients -- and can be determined from a fully differential analysis of the angular distribution of the leptons arising from the $Z$ decay. We show that analysing the dependence of these angular moments on the $Zh$ invariant mass allows us to systematically probe all higher dimension EFT operators contributing to this process.

We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."}

We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables."}

Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\\sim$$6.0 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."}
