It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve."}

Using the scale factor ansatz $α(t)=\\left(\\fracαη+t^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 η}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $χ_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution."}

In this work we present a unified theoretical picture in which Wilson loops connect nonperturbative gauge dynamics, Berry-phase topology in band theory, and the quantum Hall response of interacting electron systems. We demonstrate explicitly how Wilson loops encode Chern numbers, fractional charge, and anyonic braiding statistics within Chern--Simons effective field theory.

In contrast to large scale oscillation toolkits optimized for experimental simulations, NeutrinoOsc3Flavor is designed as a minimal dependency reference implementation, emphasizing analytical traceability, equation level accessibility, and cross platform portability. The framework relies solely on NumPy for numerical linear algebra and runs natively on both Linux and Windows systems without external compilation or specialized libraries. As an internal consistency and validation feature, we implement an independent analytical determination of the matter modified Hamiltonian eigenvalues using the Cardano method and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical diagonalization. CP Phase dependence is used as a sensitive diagnostic of numerical stability and correctness of the evolution operator in both vacuum and matter. NeutrinoOsc3Flavor is intended as a verification oriented and pedagogical computational tool, suitable for theoretical cross-checks, educational use, and benchmarking of more complex neutrino oscillation software, rather than as a replacement for full experimental simulation frameworks.

To elucidate these trends, we employ an analytical framework that explicitly connects these kiloparsec-scale properties to the timescales governing the rapid, continuous ISM gas cycle on the scales of individual star-forming regions, including the formation, dispersal, and local depletion of star-forming gas. Using a suite of idealized disk galaxy simulations spanning a range of environments from dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems to a gas-rich starburst analog, we measure the timescales of the gas cycle and relate them to the dynamical and turbulent properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that star-forming regions form on a timescale close to the vertical turbulent crossing time of the galactic disk, $\\sim$3-30 Myr, which decreases at higher $Σ_{\\rm gas}$ due to the increase in turbulent velocities in the ISM and the decrease in the disk thickness. In contrast, the local star formation and dispersal of such gas are set by the local conditions. Specifically, the local depletion time, $\\sim$200-2000 Myr, is decreasing at higher $Σ_{\\rm gas}$, as star-forming gas becomes denser and more efficient in forming stars. The lifetime of such gas is very short, $\\sim$0.4-1 Myr, and only weakly increases with $Σ_{\\rm gas}$. Together, our results demonstrate how the star formation properties of galaxies on kiloparsec scales emerge directly from the interplay between the galaxy-scale dynamics, ISM turbulence, and the state of star-forming gas."}

How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for \"first-person\" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her \"subjective state\". We advocate a \"Principle of Self-Locating Indifference\" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of \"old evidence\"."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "This report reviews key developments in Carrollian physics with an emphasis on their role in the emerging framework of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We begin by introducing the Carrollian limit, understood as the non-relativistic contraction of the Poincaré group obtained by formally taking the speed of light to zero. The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program."}

Known as the flavor pendulum, this behavior appears among the collective modes of a dense neutrino plasma after a strong reduction of phase space through symmetry assumptions. It has been identified in homogeneous slow and fast flavor systems and, most recently, in single-wave solutions of the fast system. We explain the reasons for its ubiquitous appearance. We show that a system of three classical spins must always be pendular, or only two in the presence of an external field. Furthermore, such a system always defines a continuum of vectors with time-independent length. If these are identified as interacting spins, they immediately lead to the continuum cases of slow and fast flavor pendula. As another new insight, any of these spins can be chosen as the pendulum, periodically exchanging flavor with the rest of the system."}

The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \\dot{a}(t)<0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \\dot{a}(t)>0 $) at the bouncing point $t \\approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($ω=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour."}

Following past studies of parallel ($y$-direction) CTE, we use the serial CTE trails behind hot pixels in calibration dark frames to characterize charge trapping and release in the serial registers of the WFC detectors. Serial CTE trails are sharper and longer than parallel CTE trails. Many fewer charge traps come into play during serial pixel transfers than parallel transfers, which explains why parallel CTE is much worse than serial CTE. We find that serial CTE can cause losses of $\\sim$0.005-0.02~mag in stellar photometry and shift stellar centroids by $\\sim$0.01-0.035 pixels. The pixel-based algorithm in CALACS that corrects for parallel CTE losses in WFC data has been modified to include a correction for serial CTE losses. The PCTETAB reference file has also been updated to include serial CTE parameters. The pixel-based correction for serial CTE currently runs only on full-frame WFC images obtained after SM4 (May 2009).

Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$σ$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$σ$, over $0<z<4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $Ω_{\\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal. Together these results establish a global picture of galaxy growth fueled by a larger, short-lived molecular reservoir. The CO and [CII] detections mark a turning point for line-intensity mapping, replacing forecasts with empirical line strengths and defining sensitivity requirements for upcoming 3D experiments poised to open new windows on galaxy formation and cosmology."}

Such systems can be used to provide simultaneous constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the dark-energy equation of state, independent of and complementary to other probes. However, just as for single-plane gravitational lenses, the precision of these constraints is limited by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) -- a fundamental limit to the knowledge of the mass profiles of lens galaxies and the line of sight that can be obtained from imaging constraints alone. In this work, we show explicitly how contributions from the line of sight appear in double-plane systems. Because these contributions modify angular diameter distances, we argue that cosmological priors should not be used to simply fix the ``cosmological scaling factor'', a ratio of angular diameter distances which is key to the modelling of double-plane lenses. Motivated by this fact, we generalise the double-plane MSD to account for this uncertainty in the scaling factor. While this complicates the time-delay function, we show that, using the ``unfolding relation'', a geometric relation between distances which holds even in the presence of line-of-sight corrections, the uncertainty in the Hubble constant reduces to the familiar mass-sheet transformation of the first lens plane, and a line-of-sight contribution between the observer and the second lens plane. Our main message is therefore a prescription for reducing the degrees of freedom within double-plane models, while still safely accounting for the MSD in measurements of $H_0$."}

The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity."}

The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $α$ and $β$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations."}

Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r_peri >= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r_apo >= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes."}

Stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can serve as probe of the diverse phenomenology encountered in beyond-Standard-Model scenarios featuring phase transitions in the early Universe. Focussing on gravitational wave production from first-order phase transitions, we present the main results of a recent analysis by the LISA Cosmology Working Group concerning the detectability of such signals with LISA. Strong degeneracies, both among the parameters controlling the phase transition and between these and the parameters of the beyond-Standard-Model scenario underlying the phase transition, complicate the reconstruction of the model from a potential signal. Nonetheless, once a specific scenario is assumed, LISA observations can supply constraints possibly complementary to those obtainable from present and future particle colliders."}

The measured spectra are analyzed with the Tsallis non-extensive distribution, from which the effective temperature T, non-extensive parameter q, and the mean transverse momentum mean_pT are extracted for each particle species and centrality interval. To disentangle thermal and collective effects, the mean kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 is obtained from the intercept of the T-versus-mass relation, while the average transverse flow velocity betaT is extracted from the slope of mean_pT versus the mean moving mass for pions, kaons, and protons.\n  The results show that T increases and q decreases with increasing centrality, indicating a hotter and more equilibrated system in central collisions. A clear mass dependence of T supports a multi-freeze-out scenario, with heavier particles decoupling earlier. Both T0 and betaT rise from peripheral to mid-central collisions before saturating toward central events, which may suggest the onset of collective behavior or changes in freeze-out dynamics. These observations provide new insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC."}

These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region."}

By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate. Finally, kinematic analysis and orbit integrations demonstrate that all clusters exhibit dynamical properties fully consistent with membership in the Galactic thin disc."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $α$ and $β$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations."}

Properties and performance of the NISP signal estimator", "comment": null, "summary": "The Euclid spacecraft, located at the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, hosts the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument. NISP is equipped with a mosaic of 16 HgCdTe-based detectors to acquire near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data. To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations."}

In the inner regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), the survey obtained high-resolution near-infrared APOGEE spectra (S/N~45) of ~14,000 bright, oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB-O) stars. These data provide contiguous spatial coverage of the Clouds' main bodies, enabling detailed chemo-dynamical studies. To explore extended structures, the survey includes BOSS optical spectroscopy of fainter red giant (RG) stars selected with \\gaia~DR3 data, reaching G~17.5. Many of these targets extend to the outer regions of the Clouds, which are known to span ~20 deg (LMC) and ~12 deg(SMC) and contain diffuse substructures of unclear origin. BOSS data in the inner regions also complement APOGEE by providing elements inaccessible in the near-infrared and enabling cross-calibration between instruments. The survey further includes APOGEE and BOSS observations of ~300 evolved massive stars and a small sample of symbiotic binaries previously observed by APOGEE-1 and -2, enhancing our understanding of massive stellar evolution and complementing the SDSS-V main-sequence massive star program."}

The construction is purely boundary-based and applies to superpositions of semiclassical geometries as well. As an application, we diagnose island formation and the Page transition in evaporating black holes using boundary modular evolution alone, bypassing any bulk extremization.

The proposed detectors are simple, technologically ready, and inexpensive. Yet, they can be considerably more sensitive than current experiments.

The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours. While speculative, this scenario has specific features that can be tested, and the present letter sets the basis for further phenomenological investigations."}

In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems. We compare the method to several standard analytic and semi-analytic solutions, as well as implicit Monte Carlo, P$_1$, and discrete ordinates (S$_n$). We see that the method: gives excellent agreement with known results, has stability for large time steps, has the diffusion limit for large spatial cells, and achieves $\\sim$20-70\\% performance improvement when terminating optical depths at O(10-100) in the grey Marshak and crooked pipe problems. However, for the Coax radiation-hydrodynamics problem, we see that MOC is approximately two to three times slower than IMC-DDMC and S$_n$ in its current implementation."}

This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the \"synchronized pair\" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\\ast \\sim 10^{8-9}M_\\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \\sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe."}

Astrophysical foregrounds, as the main source of contamination to the cosmological 21 cm signal, persist in a wedge-like region of Fourier space due to the inherent chromaticity in radio interferometric observations. The foreground avoidance strategy focuses on utilizing data from relatively clean regions with minimal foreground leakage, at the cost of losing large-scale information. Non-linear structure formation, however, couples Fourier modes across scales, leaving imprints of the missing large-scale modes in the remaining data. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to test whether large-scale features of the 21 cm brightness temperature fields, particularly the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), can be recovered at the field level using only short-wavelength modes that are beyond the linear scales. To explicitly assess the dependence on the training cosmology, we train the network exclusively on de-wiggled simulations, providing a controlled test of whether the reconstruction arises from physical non-linear mode coupling rather than implicit encoding of BAO features. In the ideal noise-free case, the amplitude and phase of the lost modes can be restored with high fidelity. With instrumental noise included, the reconstructed amplitude becomes biased, while the phase information remains robust. The trained network also exhibits reasonable robustness to variations in the underlying cosmological model. Together, these results suggest that mode restoration offers a complementary approach for extracting cosmological information from future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses."}

That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes.

We develop a simple semi-analytic model, based on the adiabatic conservation of the total Wald entropy, to estimate the scalar charge evolution during the binary inspiral. We also run fully nonlinear numerical-relativity simulations for different configurations, finding consistent results. The gravitational-wave phase difference between Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and General Relativity waveforms, which we use to assess detectability, is also computed.

Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications."}

This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature."}

Thus, it does not represent a vacuum solution. We also checked a cited ellipsoidal metric from the literature and found it likewise fails to satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations."}

Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive.\n  We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations.\n  Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code.\n  A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster.\n  Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach."}

By analyzing the maximal weight projection of amplitudes at the integrand level, we relate their maximally-transcendental parts to prescriptive unitarity integrals. This reveals a novel analytic structure: the prefactors multiplying the functions of maximal transcendentality are identified with the four-dimensional leading singularities of the theory. As a consequence, these prefactors admit a complete classification and can be computed using on-shell diagrams, a formalism originally developed in $\\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory. As a concrete application, we determine the two-loop prefactors for planar MHV gluon amplitudes at arbitrary multiplicity. Combining these prefactors with recent advances in the planar two-loop six-point function space and explicit six-point prescriptive-unitarity input, we construct a complete symbol ansatz and uniquely fix the maximally-transcendental part of the two-loop six-gluon MHV QCD amplitudes by imposing physical constraints.

If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes.

When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$α$, lower [O III]/H$β$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra."}

The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \\dot{a}(t)<0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \\dot{a}(t)>0 $) at the bouncing point $t \\approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($ω=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour."}

We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $α= -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys."}

If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours.

Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \\cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions. We propose that the nature of the interior region is described by CS and FS, while the exterior corresponds to Reissner Nordström."}

This classification is expressed through the structure of the irrelevant $T\\bar{T}$-like deformations that generate the theories from a Maxwell seed. Using both closed-form and perturbative methods within the Courant-Hilbert (CH) and Russo-Townsend auxiliary field formalisms, we demonstrate a precise correspondence: $\\varphi$-parity-invariant, analytic theories are generated by irrelevant deformations built from integer powers of the energy-momentum tensor scalars, $\\mathcal{O}_λ\\sim \\sum C_m (T_{μν}T^{μν})^{1-m}({T_μ}^μ{T_ν}^ν)^{m}$. Conversely, $\\varphi$-parity-violating, non-analytic theories require deformations involving both integer and half-integer powers, $\\mathcal{O}_λ\\sim \\sum C_m (T_{μν}T^{μν})^{1-m/2}({T_μ}^μ{T_ν}^ν)^{m/2}$. We prove this result in generality via a perturbative CH framework, showing that $\\varphi$-parity invariance imposes specific constraints on the expansion coefficients of the CH function $\\ell(τ)$ which, in turn, force all half-integer powers in the deformation to vanish. The classification is explicitly verified for known closed-form theories: the analytic generalized Born-Infeld model and the non-analytic examples of the $q=3/4$-deformed and \"no $τ$-maximum\" theories. Furthermore, we show how the $\\varphi$-parity transformation is consistently generalized in the presence of a marginal root-$T\\bar{T}$ coupling $γ$, and we derive the corresponding marginal and irrelevant flow equations for the studied theories."}

In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow.

The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($σ(|v_{pec}|)_\\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\\ σ_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR} - Σ_\\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching."}

We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling.

That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes.

Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties.\n  In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected.\n  We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory.

The extraction of $g_{πN}^2/(4π)$ is data-driven, relying on the analytic constraints from the left-hand cut and phase-shift data within the one-pion-exchange approximation.

Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images.

This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $α$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $α$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS."}

Using the leading charged hadron as a reference axis, the azimuthal plane is divided into Toward and Transverse regions, enabling a robust background subtraction and extending EEC measurements into the low $p_T$ regime where conventional jet-based approaches become unreliable. The method is validated through comparisons with conventional jet reconstruction results. We systematically explore the dependence of the EEC on the leading-particle transverse momentum and parton flavor. The observed scaling between the EEC peak position and the hard scale suggests that this topology-based EEC captures effectively the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes. Distinct differences are found between quark- and gluon-initiated events, reflecting their different color charges and radiation patterns. Extending the analysis to heavy flavor, EECs triggered by leading charm mesons exhibit a suppressed magnitude and a peak shifted toward larger angular separations relative to inclusive charged-particle triggers, providing a direct manifestation of the dead-cone effect. This jet-free EEC framework offers a simple and experimentally robust tool for studying the scale and flavor dependence of the QCD dynamics, with promising applications to proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC."}

We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the \"reflex motion\") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo."}

For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams.

For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams.

In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies."}

In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe."}

Two distinct models, the Tsallis-Pareto type function (model) and the combined BGBW model and Tsallis-Pareto type model have been employed to fit the pT distributions via the minimum chi-square method. The combined Hydro+Tsallis model is more reliably describing the pT spectra than the Tsallis-Pareto model. The Tsallis temperature (T), non-extensivity parameter (q), normalization constant (N0), Kinetic freeze-out temperature (T0), transverse flow velocity (betaT), and (mean pT) have been extracted through the fitting procedure via the employed models. The Tsallis-Pareto model gives T, q, N0 and mean pT while Hydro+Tsallis model gives T0, betaT, T, q, N0 and mean pT. Incorporating the values of the extracted T and q the thermodynamic quantities and response functions, including energy density (epsilon), particle density (n), entropy density (s), pressure (P), specific heat at constant volume (CV), squared speed of sound (cs2), mean free path (lambda), Knudsen number (Kn), isothermal compressibility (kappaT), and expansion coefficient (alpha) have been calculated at the freeze-out stage.

In contrast to the new SFS model, where the expansion is decelerating before reaching the pressure singularity, the FTPR scenario is preceded by a super-accelerated phantom phase. Our claim is based on the thorough study of the energy conditions showing the violations of all of them for a FTPR, and only the dominant energy one for an SFS.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A)", "summary": "Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (<10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation."}

All Yukawa couplings, CP phases, and flavor textures originate from a single complex modulus $τ$, whose vacuum expectation value controls both visible and dark sector dynamics. The same modular parameter fixes the neutrino mass matrix, determines the CP asymmetries driving resonant leptogenesis, and correlates the resulting baryon and dark matter abundances.

Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory. Conversely, in an adapted foliation there is a systematic anti-Newtonian expansion (in inverse powers of the reduced Newton constant) of the full Dirac observables whose leading terms are the Carroll ones. In particular, this provides an off-shell generalization of the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property."}

In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic."}

The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $χ_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours.

If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours.

The goal here consists of determining in this scheme quantum effects in chiral theories at one loop. Namely, the determination of finite counterterms at one loop that reestablish the Slavnov-Taylor identities, which follow from gauge symmetries. These counterterms are necessary due to the presence of evanescent symmetry-breaking terms in the classical Lagrangian needed to regularize fermion propagators. We consider a technique that allows an easier calculation of such finite effects, relying on the identification of $(D-4)/(D-4)$ terms of one-loop amplitudes with an external ghost leg. We focus on dimension-6 four-fermion operators, identifying all finite counterterms in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme at one loop, and as expected find no obstructions to the Slavnov-Taylor identities that cannot be cured by finite counterterms.

The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program."}

Here we use a quantum dynamical Krylov complexity approach to calculate the Hilbert space dimension of a black hole in 2+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity."}

A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit.

It is shown that for Majorana neutrinos propagating in a magnetic field the coherence length coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum when the vacuum frequency is much greater than the magnetic frequency ($ω_{vac} \\gg ω_B$), while it is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum if ($ω_{vac} \\ll ω_B$).

Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$ν$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $ε_{μτ}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$ν$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations."}

Upon clarifying a subtlety in the energy norm of the master scalar we show that the pseudospectra of both approaches conincide.

In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $δκ_λ$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $δκ_λ$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC."}

Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion.

By analyzing the maximal weight projection of amplitudes at the integrand level, we relate their maximally-transcendental parts to prescriptive unitarity integrals. This reveals a novel analytic structure: the prefactors multiplying the functions of maximal transcendentality are identified with the four-dimensional leading singularities of the theory. As a consequence, these prefactors admit a complete classification and can be computed using on-shell diagrams, a formalism originally developed in $\\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory. As a concrete application, we determine the two-loop prefactors for planar MHV gluon amplitudes at arbitrary multiplicity. Combining these prefactors with recent advances in the planar two-loop six-point function space and explicit six-point prescriptive-unitarity input, we construct a complete symbol ansatz and uniquely fix the maximally-transcendental part of the two-loop six-gluon MHV QCD amplitudes by imposing physical constraints.

That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes.

In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $μ$-$Σ$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $μ_0$ (matter clustering) by $\\sim 43\\%$ and $Σ_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\\sim 60\\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $Λ$CDM background, $μ_0 = 0.21\\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $Σ_0 = 0.149\\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$σ$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests."}

By incorporating the island rule, we show that the entanglement entropy of Kerr AdS black hole grows linearly at early times and declines to a constant value at late times in agreement with the well established Page curve. The novelty of this study resides in the investigation of influence of phase transitions on the page curve in two different ensembles. We find that a first order phase transition results in a sharp discontinuity in the Page curve. We study the evaporation process in different scenarios and find that in all the situations, the Page curve doesn't violate the unitary principle of quantum mechanics."}

Important non-logarithmically enhanced contributions must also be calculated. We discuss dimensional regularization in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme. The goal here consists of determining in this scheme quantum effects in chiral theories at one loop. Namely, the determination of finite counterterms at one loop that reestablish the Slavnov-Taylor identities, which follow from gauge symmetries. These counterterms are necessary due to the presence of evanescent symmetry-breaking terms in the classical Lagrangian needed to regularize fermion propagators. We consider a technique that allows an easier calculation of such finite effects, relying on the identification of $(D-4)/(D-4)$ terms of one-loop amplitudes with an external ghost leg. We focus on dimension-6 four-fermion operators, identifying all finite counterterms in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme at one loop, and as expected find no obstructions to the Slavnov-Taylor identities that cannot be cured by finite counterterms. This represents one step towards moving to higher order calculations."}

Many kinds of closed universe state", "summary": "In this paper we extend recent ideas about observers and closed universes to theories where observers can be fluctuated into existence in the Hartle-Hawking state. This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $α$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $α$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS."}

Eboli", "Rafiqul Rahaman", "Aurore Savoy Navarro"], "title": "Exploring Higgs EFT in $t\\bar{t}hh$ at High Luminosity LHC", "comment": "22 pages, 8 figures, and 6 tables", "summary": "The non-resonant production of a Higgs boson pair in association with a top-antitop quark pair ($pp\\rightarrow t\\bar{t}hh$) has only recently begun to be explored at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and provides a unique and largely uncharted probe of the top-Higgs sector, offering complementary sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling and higher-dimensional interactions beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $δκ_λ$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $δκ_λ$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC."}

For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space."}
