Using the\nhigh-resolution Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) simulations, we\ngenerate mock emission-line maps for six Milky Way-mass halos. Different ions\n(e.g., HI, OVI) trace distinct CGM phases and structures, highlighting the\nimportance of observations in multiple species. We quantify the observable CGM\nmass fraction as a function of instrument spatial resolution and surface\nbrightness sensitivity, finding that sensitivity is the dominant factor\nlimiting detectability across all ions. At fixed sensitivity, higher spatial\nresolution reveals more structures; at fixed spatial resolution, higher\nsensitivity recovers a higher percentage of the total mass. We explore CGM\nkinematics by constructing emissivity-weighted projected velocity maps and\ncomparing line-of-sight velocities between ions. OVI shows the largest\nkinematic deviation from HI, while MgII and SiII most closely follow HI\nvelocities. Distinguishing these phases out to 50kpc from the galaxy center\nrequires spectral resolution better than 30km/s for most ion pairs.\nAdditionally, separating inflowing from outflowing gas based on projected\nkinematics also requires high spectral resolution: at 30km/s, more than 80% of\ngas above the emission detection threshold can be distinguished kinematically,\nbut this fraction drops to <40% with a resolution of 200km/s. Our results\nprovide predictions for future UV and optical instruments, showing that\nrecovering the multiphase structure and kinematics of circumgalactic emission\nwill require both high sensitivity and fine kinematic resolution."}

The time lags of these lines relative to the continuum are\nmeasured as $1.3^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, $2.3^{+1.5}_{-2.1}$, $10.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$, and\n$15.6^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$ days (rest-frame), respectively. Velocity-resolved lag\nprofiles for H$\\gamma$ and H$\\beta$ were constructed. Combined with data from\nprevious seasons (2015$-$2021), we find that the radial ionization\nstratification of the broad-line region (BLR) is stable; the average virial\nmass of the supermassive black hole in NGC~5548 is $(2.6\\pm1.1)\\times\n10^{8}M_{\\odot}$, consistent with the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_*$ relation; the broad\nHe~{\\sc ii} line exhibits the largest responsivity, followed by broad He~{\\sc\ni} (or H$\\gamma$) and H$\\beta$ lines; the BLR kinematics show significant\ntemporal evolution, transitioning from virialized motions to signatures of\ninflow and outflow. Furthermore, an analysis of 35 years of historical data\nconfirms a 3.5-year time lag between variations in the optical luminosity and\nthe BLR radius, potentially implicating the role of radiation pressure or\ndynamical structure changes in the inner accretion disk.

The results suggest that, among the three frameworks,\nonly GNMSSM can naturally accommodate for light DM with a mass below $100~{\\rm\nGeV}$. As such, the viable supersymmetry candidate is primarily Singlino-like.\nOne key advantage of the GNMSSM is the effective decoupling between\ninteractions that establish the relic density and those that control direct\ndetection, allowing the model to satisfy all current experimental bounds\nsimultaneously. We further explore two characteristic mass hierarchies in the\nGNMSSM parameter space, each exhibiting distinct phenomenological behaviors.\nThe first hierarchy, $\\tilde{S} < \\tilde{B} < \\tilde{H}$\n(Singlino--Bino--Higgsino), involves a relatively light Bino and allows the\nHiggsino mass parameter, $\\mu_{\\rm tot}$, to be as low as about $200~{\\rm\nGeV}$, naturally yielding light DM at tens of GeV. The dominant annihilation\nchannels are then $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0 \\to A_sA_s$ in the $h_1$\nscenario and $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0 \\to h_sA_s$ in the $h_2$\nscenario, where $h_s$ and $A_s$ denote singlet-dominated CP-even and CP-odd\nHiggs bosons, respectively. The second hierarchy, $\\tilde{S} < \\tilde{H} <\n\\tilde{B}$, corresponds to a heavy Bino. In this case, although the DM\nphenomenology remains qualitatively similar, LHC constraints require $\\mu_{\\rm\ntot} \\gtrsim 900~{\\rm GeV}$, implying a significant degree of fine-tuning in\nreproducing the $Z$-boson mass."}

The S band is ideal for studying magnetic fields in spiral\ngalaxies due to the weak Faraday depolarization.

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to\nstudy the various azimuthal modes found in the RM data of the galaxy. The RM\nsynthesis analysis indicates the direction of the magnetic field along the line\nof sight throughout the entire disk. Leveraging the sensitivity and high\nresolution provided by MeerKAT's S-band capability, this study achieves an\nunprecedented level of detail of the magnetic field structure.

This can\noccur, e.g., when leptons from secondary decays are incorrectly identified as\noriginating from the hard-scatter interaction point (known as non-prompt\nleptons), or when other physics objects, such as hadronic jets, are mistakenly\nreconstructed as leptons (resulting in mis-identified leptons). These fake\nleptons are usually estimated using data-driven techniques, one of the most\ncommon being the Fake Factor method. This method relies on predicting the fake\nlepton contribution by reweighting data events, using a scale factor (i.e. fake\nfactor) function. Traditionally, fake factors have been estimated by\nhistogramming and computing the ratio of two data distributions, typically as\nfunctions of a few relevant physics variables such as the transverse momentum\n$p_\\text{T}$ and pseudorapidity $\\eta$. In this work, we introduce a novel\napproach of fake factor calculation, based on density ratio estimation using\nneural networks trained directly on data in a higher-dimensional feature space.\nWe show that our method enables the computation of a continuous, unbinned fake\nfactor on a per event basis, offering a more flexible, precise, and\nhigher-dimensional alternative to the conventional method, making it applicable\nto a wide range of analyses. A simple LHC open data analysis we implemented\nconfirms the feasibility of the method and demonstrates that the ML-based fake\nfactor provides smoother, more stable estimates across the phase space than\ntraditional methods, reducing binning artifacts and improving extrapolation to\nsignal regions."}

This is one way in which close pairs of galaxies show galactic\nconformity, which is thought to be driven by assembly bias. Such conformity is\nseen in ages, morphologies and star formation rates in different samples. This\npaper revisits a high signal-to-noise SDSS spectroscopic sample, by spectral\nfitting of new stellar population models, to investigate satellite galaxy\nproperties of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance.

The offsets showing age\nconformity are not caused by age-metallicity degeneracies.

We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become\nparticularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled\nfermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By\naccounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the\nfine-structure constant \\alpha behaves as an energy-dependent running\nparameter, given by \\(\\alpha_{eff(E)}/\\alpha \\approx 1 - \\frac{E}{4E_p}\\),\nwhere E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a\nfirst-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied\nto positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce\nshifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified\ntwo-body equations have not been previously studied. This model is the first of\nits kind, opening new avenues for further research in this area."}

We perform the resummation of the\nlogarithmically-enhanced effects due to simultaneous QCD and QED initial-state\nradiation, up to mixed next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. We\nstudy the impact of such mixed QCD$\\otimes$QED resummed contributions on top of\npure QCD corrections, finding percent-level effects."}

In addition, we demonstrate that the same modes can be recovered\nthrough a purely geometric Kerr-Schild construction. This equivalent approach\noffers a new geometric understanding of the Schwarzian sector and highlights\nthe correspondence between perturbative and pure geometric approaches,\nadditionally it provides a connection with double copy and double field theory."}

This enhancement arises from the growth of density\nperturbations during the eMD era and their rapid oscillations during the era\nwith pressure. This phenomenon is called the poltergeist mechanism. In this\nreview, we explain the essence of the poltergeist mechanism and explore\nconcrete scenarios in which such an enhancement can occur."}
