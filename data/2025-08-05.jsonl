We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in\nthe context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although\nthese conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these\nconjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic.

Some models are\nbased on the NC local Lorentz symmetry, while others rely on NC deformations of\nthe diffeomorphism symmetry of GR. In this paper, we investigate the connection\nbetween two NC gravity models based on twisted and braided NC diffeomorphism\nsymmetry. Although these two models yield different NC gravity actions, we show\nthat, in certain cases, they lead to the same phenomenological consequences.

In\nthis model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition\nfunction of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a\ntopological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT\npartition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold\nwith some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed\nboundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and\nthe extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum,\nthat is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated\nabelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be\nconvergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the\nexistence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the\nensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a\ncertain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into\nsums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently\nfor each prime $p$."}

Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson\nvariational double complex $\\Omega(J^\\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange\nequations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for\na free field on a $\\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative\ngeometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including\nwith a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange\nequations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain\nan exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a\nscalar field on the lattice."}
