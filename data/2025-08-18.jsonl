The\nmetric and fluxes are complicated functions of up to five coordinates. There\nare also many duals of heavy pure states that cannot be described in\nsupergravity, but only admit a worldsheet description. Extracting the physical\nproperties of these solutions is technically challenging. In this paper, we\nshow that there are much simpler effective descriptions of these solutions that\ncapture many of their stringy and geometrical features, at the price of\nsacrificing supergravity smoothness. In particular, the effective description\nof some families of superstrata, and of certain worldsheet solutions, is given\nby easy-to-construct three-center solutions. For example, the effective\ndescription of a superstratum with a long AdS$_2$ throat is a scaling,\nthree-center solution in which the momentum wave is collapsed to a singular\nsource at one of the three centers. This also highlights how momentum migrates\naway from the supertube locus in the back-reacted geometry. Our results suggest\nthat effective descriptions can be extended to more general microstates, and\nthat many singular multi-center solutions can in fact correspond to effective\ndescriptions of smooth horizonless microstructure."}

However, a small fraction of the most massive galaxies which are no\nlonger forming stars (i.e., they are quiescent) are dispersion supported, and\nare termed 'slow-rotators.' These galaxies, which are highly evolved and often\nexist in dense cluster environments, are theorized to be formed by a history of\nmerger activity that on average decreases the angular momentum of the merged\nsystem and disturbs any disk structure. At high redshift, such extreme\nslow-rotating systems are predicted to be far less common. While observations\nof massive high-redshift galaxies which enable kinematic studies are\nchallenging to obtain, all previous data have revealed systems that are\nrotating rapidly. No slow-rotators have been confirmed from stellar kinematics\nbeyond z~2. In this work we present results from James Webb Space Telescope\nnear-infrared integral field spectroscopy of XMM-VID1-2075, a massive,\nquiescent galaxy at z=3.449 with a morphology exhibiting clear low-surface\nbrightness asymmetries and with a measured spin parameter of $\\lambda _{R_e} =\n0.101 \\pm 0.018$, consistent with the lack of rotation seen in slow rotators in\nthe local Universe.

This study aims to characterize how the PAH\nionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for\nspectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in\nintense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field\nspectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium\nResolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for\neach of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the\nprominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key\ndiagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population.\nResults: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in\ntheir PAH spectral characteristics.

Solving such\nequations in some generic off-diagonal forms is usually a hard analytic or\nnumeric task. Physically important solutions in GR were constructed using a\ndiagonal ansatz for metrics with a maximum of 4 independent coefficients. The\nEinstein equations can be solved in exact or parametric forms determined by\nsome integration constants for corresponding assumptions on spherical or\ncylindrical spacetime symmetries. The anholonomic frame and connection\ndeformation method allows us to construct generic off-diagonal solutions\ndescribed by 6 independent coefficients of metrics depending, in general, on\nall spacetime coordinates. New types of exact and parametric solutions are\ndetermined by generating and integration functions and (effective) generating\nsources.

The\nresulting polynomial equations in the integer $\\mathfrak{u}_1$ charges define a\nprojective cubic hypersurface over the field of rational numbers. Generically,\nsuch a hypersurface is (by a theorem of Koll\\'{a}r) a unirational variety,\nmaking it possible to find a finitely-many-to-one parametrization of all\nsolutions (of which there are necessarily infinitely many). (Otherwise, such a\nhypersurface is either reducible or is a cone over an elliptic curve and all\nsolutions can again be found in practice.) As an example, for the Standard\nModel Lie algebra with its three generations of quarks and leptons (or even\nwith just a single generation and two $\\mathfrak{su}_3 \\oplus\n\\mathfrak{su}_2$-singlet right-handed neutrinos), it follows that there are\ninfinitely many anomaly-free possibilities for the $\\mathfrak{u}_1$\nhypercharges."}

Using the generic-isospin extension of the\nRFT formalism and applying our open-source Python library to implement the\nframework, we predict a range of three-pion energies for illustrative values of\nthe two-to-two scattering amplitudes for various finite-volume irreps also with\nnon-zero total momentum $\\boldsymbol P$ in the finite-volume frame. The results\nrestrict attention to the case of a vanishing intrinsic three-body interaction\nso that the spectra can be understood as a baseline. In future lattice QCD\ncalculations, deviations from these values will be translated into evidence for\nintrinsic three-body effects in the various scattering channels."}
