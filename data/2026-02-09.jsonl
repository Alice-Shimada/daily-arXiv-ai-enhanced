Accepted by PRD", "summary": "In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND."}

Recent RM campaigns yielded direct BH masses through dynamical modeling for a sample of 32 objects, spanning a wide range of AGN luminosities and BH masses. In addition, accurate BH masses have been determined by spatially resolving the broad-line region with GRAVITY for a handful of AGNs. Here, we present a detailed analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images using surface-brightness profile fitting with state-of-the-art programs. We derive AGN luminosity and host-galaxy properties, such as radii and luminosities for spheroid, disk, and bar (if present). The spheroid effective radii were used to measure stellar velocity dispersion from integral-field spectroscopy. Since the BH masses of our sample do not depend on any assumption of the virial factor needed in single-epoch spectroscopic mass estimates, we can show that the resulting scaling relations between the mass of the supermassive BHs and their host galaxies match those of quiescent galaxies, naturally extending to lower masses in these (predominantly) spiral galaxies. We find that the inner AGN orientation, as traced by the broad-line region inclination angle, is uncorrelated with the host-galaxy disk. Our sample has the most direct and accurate MBH measurements of any AGN sample and provides a fundamental local benchmark for studies of the evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic time."}

Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \\propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits. In model independent approach to $f(R)$ gravity with the generic scalaron fields ($ψ=f'(R)$), we extract the parameters of $f(R)$ gravity from the current bounds on Parametrised Post Newtonian (PPN) parameters ($γ, β$) near the GC black hole. The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters. It has been found that sufficiently massive scalarons ($10^{-16}$ eV) are completely screened but light and intermediate mass scalarons ($10^{-22}$ eV and $10^{-19}$ eV) are unscreened towards S0-2 like orbits as well as in the orbit of the newly discovered short period star S4716 ($a=407$ au). The possibility of detection of the $f(R)$ gravity effects due to these unscreened scalarons is forecasted with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs)."}

While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating."}

Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.\n  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.\n  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds."}

For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to the CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift -- when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important -- the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, thus probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of an oscillatory pattern in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are low-significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years."}

We build a simplified cluster evolutionary model in the $Λ$CDM framework to constrain the characteristic timescales of this transformation. In our model, field spirals joining the cluster are subject to ram-pressure stripping (RPS), which removes their gas reservoir leading to the quenching of their star formation on a timescale $t_{\\rm s}$, and to an (initially) unspecified mechanism that transforms them into S0s on a timescale $t_{\\rm m}$. We assume that $t_{\\rm s}$ and $t_{\\rm m}$ are independent and both power-law functions of $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$, the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio. We constrain our model using the observed distribution of spirals and S0s in a color-mass plane from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS cluster surveys at $z\\simeq0.055$ and $z\\simeq0.7$. Our best-fit model reproduces the data remarkably well and predicts evolutionary trends for the main morphological fractions in agreement with previous studies. We find typical $t_{\\rm s}$ between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr, compatible with previous estimates. A surprisingly strong anti-correlation between $t_{\\rm s}$ and $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ is required in order to suppress the formation of red, low-mass spirals at low redshift, which we interpret as driven by orbit anisotropy. Conversely, $t_{\\rm m}$ depends very weakly on $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ and has typical values of a few Gyr. The inferred morphological evolution is compatible with that resulting from the ageing of the stellar populations in galaxies abruptly quenched by ram pressure stripping: we confirm spectrophotometric ageing as a key channel for the spiral-to-S0 transition in galaxy clusters, with secular evolution playing a secondary role."}

The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.

A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies."}

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for.

In such simulations, AGN feedback seeded as powerful outflows leads to extended and luminous nebulae whose morphology and surface-brightness profiles accurately reproduce the observations, while suppressing AGN feedback leads to compact and faint nebulae. This link might arise from outflows opening up a channel for Ly$α$ photons to escape from the galactic nucleus to the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The main aim of this paper is to test this theoretical prediction using observations, by comparing the physical properties of outflows and Ly$α$ nebulae. We analyze integral-field unit data obtained with VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace the ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a sample of six quasars at $z\\sim2-3$, using the [O III] emission line.

Four of our quasars are spatially resolved and show signs of extended [O III] emission out to distances $>2$ kpc from the central supermassive black hole.

Additionally, we find evidence of spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the inner and brightest regions of the Ly$α$ nebula.

In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "(Abridged) A thorough interpretation of the current and upcoming generation of cosmological observations requires unprecedented large-scale, high-resolution simulations spanning multiple cosmological models and parameters. The realization of these computationally demanding simulations poses a crucial technical challenge. We present beyond - $Λ$CDM implementations of the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, a performance-enhancing technique tailored for large-scale simulations that produce lightcone-like outputs. This approach dynamically decreases the resolution of a simulation in the regions that are not in causal connection with the observer, saving computational resources without directly affecting the physical properties within the lightcone. We implemented the DZS algorithm in two state-of-the-art codes supporting non-standard cosmologies, namely modified $f(R)$ gravity in Arepo and dark sector interactions in Gadget4. We analyzed result accuracy and performance gains across resolution, simulation volume and model by comparing runs performed with and without the DZS algorithm. Our DZS reproduce the lightcone halo mass function, sky-projected massmaps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra with an accuracy of $\\simeq$ 0.1% or higher in most cases. In terms of performance, DZS runs in our test simulations can save up to $\\sim$ 50% runtime compared to the non-DZS counterparts. A scaling to larger simulated volumes suggests that performance gains could improve by an additional $\\sim$ 20% at the resolution levels of current state-of-the-art simulations. The validation of the DZS algorithm in non-standard models demonstrates that this technique can enable cost effective, large-scale ($\\gtrsim$ 1 cGpc/h) simulations with state-of-the-art resolution, providing the computational framework needed to constrain and help the interpretation of forthcoming data."}

This `$J_\\varphi$-${\\overline{v}}_R$ wave' signal also exhibits a systematic phase shift when stars are binned by their dynamical temperatures. However, the origin of the wave is unknown. Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ wave signal. However, short-lived spiral arms can, and by performing an MCMC fit we identify a spiral perturbation that drives a $J_\\varphi$-${\\overline{v}}_R$ signal in reasonable agreement with the data.

Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified Pöschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals."}

Adopting a few simple phenomenological models, we quantitatively demonstrate that a satisfactory fit with a model with late-time expansion history can only be achieved if one of the following is true: 1) there is a sharp step in the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae at very low redshift, $z\\sim 0.01$, or 2) the distance duality relation, $d_L(z)=(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, is broken. Both solutions are trivial in that they effectively decouple the calibrated SNIa measurements from other data, and this qualitatively agrees with previous work built on studying specific dark-energy models. We also identify a less effective class of late-time solutions with a transition at $z\\simeq 0.15$ that lead to a more modest improvement in fit to the data than models with a very low-z transition. Our conclusions are largely unchanged when we include surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements, with their current systematic uncertainties, to our analysis.

For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with ξRφ^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of ξ), only when ξ\\le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For ξ> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for ξ\\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed."}

For the South Pole Telescope's third-generation camera (SPT-3G), accurate characterization of the beam is critical for understanding the polarized mm-wave sky. Here, we present direct measurements of SPT-3G's polarized beam response using observations of 100 polarized extragalactic point sources. Previous SPT-3G CMB power spectrum analyses introduced a phenomenological parameter $β_\\mathrm{pol}$ to describe the degree of polarization preserved in beam sidelobes. These analyses found evidence for significant depolarization driven by the requirement of polarization power spectrum consistency between different frequency bands. Our direct measurements yield $β_\\mathrm{pol}=0.90\\pm0.10$ at 95 GHz, $1.01\\pm0.12$ at 150 GHz, and $0.81\\pm0.29$ at 220 GHz, indicating minimal sidelobe depolarization. We validate these results through extensive systematic tests including Bayesian posterior sampling versus frequentist bootstrap resampling, real-space versus Fourier-space analysis, and variations on temperature-to-polarization leakage handling, covariance determination, and source selection. When compared to values inferred from previous cosmological analyses, which favored significant depolarization to resolve inter-frequency power spectrum inconsistencies, we find a mild tension of $1.9σ$. However, this apparent discrepancy is dependent on the beam modeling, as our point source-based analysis derives much of its constraining power on $β_\\mathrm{pol}$ from higher multipoles than the power spectrum analysis. These measurements therefore admit three explanations for the frequency-dependent residuals observed in the power spectrum analysis: a statistical fluctuation, the need for more sophisticated polarized beam models, or systematics other than beam depolarization."}

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects."}

In this paper, we derive splashback radii for this cluster ensemble from galaxy density profiles and constrain the mass threshold of the survey as a function of redshift. We use MaDCoWS2 cluster candidates at $0.4\\leq z \\leq 1.65$ divided into subsamples with different signal-to-noise (S/N$_{\\rm P}$) and redshifts, cross-correlated with galaxies from the CatWISE2020 catalog, to obtain average surface density profiles. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive parameter estimates for theoretical models consisting of orbiting and infalling terms. A distinct splashback feature is detected in all subsamples. The measured splashback radii span from $0.89^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc/cMpc ($0.61^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ proper Mpc/pMpc) at $\\overline{z}=0.45$ to $1.27^{+0.05}_{-0.05}h^{-1}$ cMpc ($0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}h^{-1}$ pMpc) at $\\overline{z}=1.54$. We also find that splashback radii increase with $S/N_{\\rm P}$ at fixed redshift. The resultant splashback radii constrain the redshift dependence of the mass of MaDCoWS2 clusters at fixed $S/N_{\\rm P}$. We calculate $M_{\\rm 200m}$ from the radii using a relation based on a cosmological simulation. MaDCoWS2 $M_{\\rm 200m}$ values derived from the simulation-based relation are lower than the expected values based on weak-lensing observations. More robust mass constraints will come from calibrating splashback radii derived from galaxy density profiles with weak lensing shear profiles from facilities such as $\\textit{Euclid}$, Rubin, and $\\textit{Roman}$."}

Building upon the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach and the FastPM solver, our code employs domain decomposition to efficiently distribute memory between nodes. Although communication overhead increases the per-step runtime of the MPI version by roughly a factor of eight relative to the shared-memory implementation, our scaling tests-spanning different particle numbers, core counts, and node layouts-show nearly linear scaling with respect to both the number of particles and the number of CPU cores. Furthermore, to significantly reduce computational costs during the initial burn-in phase, we introduce a novel ``guess'' module that rapidly generates a high-quality initial density field. The results of the simulation test confirm substantial efficiency gains: for $256^3$ particles, 53 steps ($\\sim$54 CPU hours) are saved; for $1024^3$, 106 steps ($\\sim$7500 CPU hours). The relative gain grows with the number of particles, rendering large-volume reconstructions computationally practical for upcoming surveys, including our planned ELUCID-DESI reconstruction simulation with $8192^3$ particles, with a rough estimation of 720 steps ($\\sim$37,000,000 CPU hours)."}

In particular, this structure exhibits a novel chiral symmetry breaking pattern involving both second- and first-order phase transitions, a feature absent in flat spacetime. We further demonstrate that PBHs act as genuine catalysts for the chiral phase transition by analyzing the bounce solution in curved spacetime. The presence of PBHs substantially enhances the inverse duration parameter $β/H$ while leaving the overall transition strength comparable to that in flat spacetime.

We report detections of splashback radii in total light stacks, i.e. image stacks centered on the cores of galaxy clusters. Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\\slash N$) ratios. We adopt a statistical approach, using 1000 bootstrap realizations to determine the median projected splashback radius and its confidence interval in a given bin. We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts. We present a potential application of this new technique to probe the evolution of the stellar mass in cluster infalling regions."}

We find that ETGs and OGs show no significant environmental dependence: their mass-size slopes and intercepts are statistically consistent across CGs, groups, and the field. LTGs also follow similar relations in the field and in most groups, with only a modest tendency for LTGs in CGs to be smaller at fixed stellar mass. By contrast, TGs display a clear environmental signal: in groups the slope steepens to $α\\sim 0.4$ (versus $α\\sim 0.2$ in the field) and their sizes are smaller than in the field, with non-overlapping 95\\% posterior intervals. These trends suggest that TGs in denser environments are more structurally evolved, likely owing to enhanced bulge prominence and fading of the outer disc, consistent with the Sérsic-index distributions, which show an excess of TGs with $n_r \\gtrsim 1.5$ in groups and CGs.

By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes."}

For the South Pole Telescope's third-generation camera (SPT-3G), accurate characterization of the beam is critical for understanding the polarized mm-wave sky. Here, we present direct measurements of SPT-3G's polarized beam response using observations of 100 polarized extragalactic point sources. Previous SPT-3G CMB power spectrum analyses introduced a phenomenological parameter $β_\\mathrm{pol}$ to describe the degree of polarization preserved in beam sidelobes. These analyses found evidence for significant depolarization driven by the requirement of polarization power spectrum consistency between different frequency bands. Our direct measurements yield $β_\\mathrm{pol}=0.90\\pm0.10$ at 95 GHz, $1.01\\pm0.12$ at 150 GHz, and $0.81\\pm0.29$ at 220 GHz, indicating minimal sidelobe depolarization. We validate these results through extensive systematic tests including Bayesian posterior sampling versus frequentist bootstrap resampling, real-space versus Fourier-space analysis, and variations on temperature-to-polarization leakage handling, covariance determination, and source selection. When compared to values inferred from previous cosmological analyses, which favored significant depolarization to resolve inter-frequency power spectrum inconsistencies, we find a mild tension of $1.9σ$. However, this apparent discrepancy is dependent on the beam modeling, as our point source-based analysis derives much of its constraining power on $β_\\mathrm{pol}$ from higher multipoles than the power spectrum analysis. These measurements therefore admit three explanations for the frequency-dependent residuals observed in the power spectrum analysis: a statistical fluctuation, the need for more sophisticated polarized beam models, or systematics other than beam depolarization."}

We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies.

For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \\texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \\texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \\textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition. Our results demonstrate the power of reionization observables as a precision probe of PBH evaporation and other scenarios involving late-time energy injection."}

This intrinsic X-ray weakness is considered a requirement for the formation of radiatively driven winds. To obtain an unbiased view on the connection between X-ray emission and the presence of powerful winds in the most luminous quasar phase, we present an X-ray analysis of a sample of extremely luminous, radio-quiet quasars with signatures of strong outflows in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission spectra. We study the $Chandra$ X-ray spectral properties of 10 objects, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasar catalogue based on their UV luminosities and ${\\rm C}_{\\rm IV}$ emission line blueshifts, comparing them to typical optically blue quasars. Our analysis reveals that seven out of 10 quasars in our sample have photon indices $Γ>1.7$. Only two out of 10 objects exhibiting outflows with velocities exceeding 1400 km/s are X-ray 'weak', consistent with the fraction of X-ray 'weak' objects generally observed in quasar populations. Notably, one of the objects identified as X-ray 'weak' is likely an intrinsically X-ray 'normal' quasar that is heavily obscured. We observe a tentative indication at a $\\sim$2$σ$ confidence level that the correlation between the excessively low X-ray flux level and the presence of ${\\rm C}_{\\rm IV}$ emission-line outflows might emerge at wind velocities greater than 3000 km/s.

We review arguments demonstrating that in quantum gravity the algebra of observables at infinity is complete, both in AdS and in asymptotically flat space. This completeness implies that the bulk Hilbert space in quantum gravity does not factorize along the radial direction, undermining a key common assumption in Hawking's argument for information loss and in initial derivations of the Page curve. As a consequence, in a standard theory of gravity, information does not ``emerge'' from a black hole in the manner suggested by the Page curve; rather, it is already encoded in asymptotic observables. Relatedly, the full black hole interior, and not just an ``island'', can be reconstructed from exterior data. Page curves and islands can be obtained by removing the Hamiltonian from the exterior algebra. This may be implemented operationally by restricting access to part of the asymptotic region (a detector with a ``blind spot'') or, in the special case of null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, by formally discarding the Hamiltonian from the set of observables despite its physical accessibility. Such Page curves describe only the redistribution of information between measured and unmeasured degrees of freedom, rather than fundamental information recovery. Finally, Page curves and islands also arise when a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath, a setup that yields a nonstandard theory of gravity. We show how, even in this setting, the unusual localization of information in gravity provides a concrete physical mechanism for information transfer from the gravitational system into the bath."}

Accurate measurements of cluster's total masses are therefore essential, yet they can be challenging, particularly for clusters with complex morphologies, as simple mass profiles are often adopted to fit the measurements. In this work, we focus on the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters: a sample of six extremely massive systems, that, in most cases, exhibit highly complex mass distributions. The BUFFALO survey extended the Hubble Space Telescope observations for the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, providing high-resolution multi-band imaging within a few Mpc. Combining this high-quality imaging dataset with ancillary spectroscopy, we produce weak-lensing catalogues with very high source densities, about 50 sources/arcmin$^2$. This allows us to robustly estimate the individual weak-lensing cluster masses and quantify the sensitivity of these measurements on different factors, such as the cluster centring, the uncertainty on the redshift distribution or the foreground contamination and boost factor correction. This provides a data-driven analysis of the different sources of systematics that can impact such measurements. We find that the largest sources of systematic bias arise for the most disturbed clusters, such as the multi-modal, merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744. This analysis sets a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of systematics on the weak-lensing estimates of cluster masses, and in particular, in the case of unrelaxed clusters. This can play a key role in forthcoming cosmological analyses based on wide-field surveys such as Euclid and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time of the Rubin Observatory."}

Accepted by PRD", "summary": "In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND."}

Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.\n  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.\n  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds."}

If detected, this radiation could provide a fair opportunity to study the properties of neutrinos and the medium through which they move, since the properties of the radiation depend on both. Motivated by the possibility of the nuclear matter spin-polarization, in this paper, we study the new properties to $SLν$ obtained under the influence of net matter polarization. We demonstrate that the polarization can enhance or completely suppress the radiation. Also, it introduces a characteristic asymmetry into the total radiation from the compact object, which could be an observable feature dependent on the matter polarization and the magnetic field inside the stellar (if the field is connected to the stellar matter polarization). The research may have implications for the physics of NS and magnetars, bringing us closer to the possibility of studying their internal structure."}

This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary. This provides a more robust identification of bulk time delay and angular deflection through singularities of position-space correlators."}

For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature."}

Rather than attempting an exhaustive survey of all existing approaches, this comparative review provides a unified framework for the major haloscope classes, establishing a common language for the descriptions of signal generation, noise properties, data analysis, and scanning strategies.\n  Key properties of ultralight bosonic dark matter relevant for detection are summarized first, including coherence time, spectral linewidth, and stochasticity under the standard halo model.

Such dipole portals naturally arise in dark sectors where the dark matter is neutral under a hidden $U(1)_D$, and they lead to phenomenology distinct from conventional vector-current interactions. We consider the direct-detection signals arising from dark matter-nucleus scattering including the Migdal effect, dark matter-electron scattering, and semiconductor targets, which allow sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter masses, together with the cosmological bounds from such as thermal relic abundance, cosmic microwave background, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic-rays. We find that the dark dipole coupling can be largely constrained by direct detection (in particular, electric dipole coupling). However, the cosmological observations have already constrained most of the parameter space, in particular for magnetic dipole interactions of $U(1)_D$ for sub-GeV dark matter. For the dark matter mass below 10 MeV, the semiconductor (in particular, using skipper-CCD) experiments can play a crucial role in probing the dark dipole interactions: future low-threshold experiments utilizing the semiconductor targets can further extend the constraints. Our results have demonstrated that the sub-GeV dark matter with dark dipole interactions can be still safe from the direct-detection constraints, and the future low-threshold semiconductor experiments may play a significant role in constraining the dark dipole interactions."}

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects."}

Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\\slash N$) ratios. We adopt a statistical approach, using 1000 bootstrap realizations to determine the median projected splashback radius and its confidence interval in a given bin. We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts. We present a potential application of this new technique to probe the evolution of the stellar mass in cluster infalling regions."}

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature."}

Studying their thermodynamics reveals that the temperature associated to these solutions does not depend on the black hole mass, similar to the Witten black hole. We also find that their asymptotic symmetry group is more stringent than the BMS group. We consider the charged generalisations for these black holes, which introduces closed timelike curves within the inner horizon. We show that these black holes can be derived from the large-$d$ limit of the Myers-Perry black hole.

We review arguments demonstrating that in quantum gravity the algebra of observables at infinity is complete, both in AdS and in asymptotically flat space. This completeness implies that the bulk Hilbert space in quantum gravity does not factorize along the radial direction, undermining a key common assumption in Hawking's argument for information loss and in initial derivations of the Page curve. As a consequence, in a standard theory of gravity, information does not ``emerge'' from a black hole in the manner suggested by the Page curve; rather, it is already encoded in asymptotic observables. Relatedly, the full black hole interior, and not just an ``island'', can be reconstructed from exterior data. Page curves and islands can be obtained by removing the Hamiltonian from the exterior algebra. This may be implemented operationally by restricting access to part of the asymptotic region (a detector with a ``blind spot'') or, in the special case of null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, by formally discarding the Hamiltonian from the set of observables despite its physical accessibility. Such Page curves describe only the redistribution of information between measured and unmeasured degrees of freedom, rather than fundamental information recovery. Finally, Page curves and islands also arise when a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath, a setup that yields a nonstandard theory of gravity. We show how, even in this setting, the unusual localization of information in gravity provides a concrete physical mechanism for information transfer from the gravitational system into the bath."}

The reduction of the uncertainties associated to these developments has brought previously neglected effects into focus as their typical magnitude are competitive with the size of the uncertainties. One such effect is the inclusion of QED into PDF fits. Typically this is a percent effect, and thus while theoretically important, it has had a relatively limited impact on phenomenological studies up to this point. In this proceeding we study some of the effects which, while peripheral to the inclusion of QED in the proton, can considerably change the relative size and shape of the QCD+QED fit with respect to the QCD only determination. These may become important in the future as precision continues to increase. After a comparison of the QCD+QED PDFs with the QCD only PDFs of various global PDF fitting groups, we focus largely upon NNPDF4.0, which shows the biggest effect when including QED. Focusing largely on a single set of PDFs also enables more subtle effects to be analysed, making it an ideal candidate for this study."}

This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary. This provides a more robust identification of bulk time delay and angular deflection through singularities of position-space correlators."}

We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run."}

We introduce three- and four-dimensional solutions that are rotating, asymptotically flat, and exhibit a linear dilaton vacuum. These solutions cannot be overspun, i.e., do not have an extremality condition, akin to higher-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with one rotational angle. Studying their thermodynamics reveals that the temperature associated to these solutions does not depend on the black hole mass, similar to the Witten black hole. We also find that their asymptotic symmetry group is more stringent than the BMS group. We consider the charged generalisations for these black holes, which introduces closed timelike curves within the inner horizon. We show that these black holes can be derived from the large-$d$ limit of the Myers-Perry black hole. As such we advocate that large-$d$ can provide a useful vantage point to interpret the here introduced black holes, as well as more generally a way to generate new effective field theories and corresponding non-trivial solutions."}

Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.\n  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.\n  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds."}

Despite their diverse physical origins -- such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity -- SGWB anisotropies exhibit a universal angular structure. We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations."}

Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes."}
