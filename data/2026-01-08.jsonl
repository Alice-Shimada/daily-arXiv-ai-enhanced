This Flavour Autobiography is dedicated to my flavour collaborators", "summary": "I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics."}

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will observe an unprecedented number density of galaxies. As a result, the majority of imaged galaxies will visually overlap, a phenomenon known as blending. Blending is expected to be a leading source of systematic error in astronomical measurements. To mitigate this systematic, we propose a new probabilistic method for detecting, deblending, and measuring the properties of galaxies, called the Bayesian Light Source Separator (BLISS). Given an astronomical survey image, BLISS uses convolutional neural networks to produce a probabilistic astronomical catalog by approximating the posterior distribution over the number of light sources, their centroids' locations, and their types (galaxy vs. star). BLISS additionally includes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct unblended galaxy profiles. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility of BLISS for cosmological applications, we apply our method to simulated single-band images whose properties are representative of year-10 LSST coadds. First, we study each BLISS component independently and examine its probabilistic output as a function of SNR and degree of blending. Then, by propagating the probabilistic detections from BLISS to its deblender, we produce per-object flux posteriors. Using these posteriors yields a substantial improvement in aperture flux residuals relative to deterministic detections alone, particularly for highly blended and faint objects. These results highlight the potential of BLISS as a scalable, uncertainty-aware tool for mitigating blending-induced systematics in next-generation cosmological surveys."}

Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z>0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations."}

Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources."}

MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive.

This effect systematically introduces interloper galaxies into the sample. Conventional strict selection not only struggles to secure high redshift purity but also drastically reduces completeness by discarding valuable data. To overcome this limitation, we develop an XGBoost classifier that leverages photometric properties and spectroscopic diagnostics to construct a high-purity redshift catalog while maximizing completeness. We validate this method on a simulated sample with spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. Of the $\\sim$62 million galaxies that obtain valid redshifts (parent sample), approximately 43% achieve accurate measurements, defined as $|Δz| \\leq 0.002(1+z)$. From this parent sample, the XGBoost classifier selects galaxies with a selection efficiency of 42.3% on the test set and 42.2% when deployed on the entire parent sample. Crucially, among the retained galaxies, 96.6% (parent sample: 96.5%) achieve accurate measurements, while the outlier fraction ($|Δz|>0.01(1+z)$) is constrained to 0.13% (0.11%). We verified that simplified configurations which exclude either spectroscopic diagnostics (except the measured redshift) or photometric data yield significantly higher outlier fractions, increasing by factors of approximately 3.5 and 6.3 respectively, with the latter case also introducing notable catastrophic interloper contamination. This framework effectively resolves the purity-completeness trade-off, enabling robust large-scale cosmological studies with CSST and similar surveys."}

Nearby spirals, including the Milky Way, host thin and thick components that may arise either from an early turbulent phase or from the subsequent dynamical heating of an initially thin disc; measuring disc thickness across cosmic time therefore offers a direct test of these scenarios. We present a new methodology to measure the thickness of edge-on galaxies that explicitly accounts for small departures from perfectly edge-on orientations by fitting a full three-dimensional model with forward modelling. This improves on traditional approaches that assume an inclination of $90^\\circ$ and can bias thicknesses high. Applying the method to \\textit{JWST} imaging of galaxies at $1<z<3$ with stellar masses $\\gtrsim 10^9~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ from four major surveys, we measure a median scale height of $z_0 = 0.25\\pm0.14~\\mathrm{kpc}$ and a median ratio $h_r/z_0 = 8.4\\pm3.7$.

We further show that a thick disc contributing 10\\% of the thin-disc luminosity would be detectable in the data considered in this work, implying that any thick disc present must be fainter and favouring a scenario in which thick discs build up progressively through dynamical heating."}

We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions."}

We conducted a detailed study of the distribution of oxygen abundance across the system using a series of strong-line O/H indicators and calibrations. Both galaxies exhibit negative galactocentric abundance gradients with a slope -0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$. There are marginal signs of discontinuities in the O/H gradients with some indicators while no significant azimuthal variations are seen. A shallower slope in the HII region luminosity function between the arm and inter-arm regions in IC 2163 is observed, supporting previous conclusion that the star formation process in this galaxy eyelids has been altered during the interaction. The kinematics of the ionised gas reveal disturbed velocity fields, AGN-like features in the nucleus of NGC 2207, and elevated velocity dispersion in turbulent or feedback-driven regions.

In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework of Eynard et.al. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten. Our predictions yield new growth formulae for the cases of ${N} {=} 2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity."}

Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\\%, 1.5\\%, and 3.5\\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations.

In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore."}

While the $Λ$CDM model successfully describes a wide range of observations, the physical nature of dark energy is still unknown, motivating the study of alternative theories of gravity. Among these, $f(R)$ models provide a well-established extension of General Relativity, capable of reproducing a $Λ$CDM-like background evolution without introducing an explicit dark energy component. However, they can induce deviations in the growth of cosmic structures, making them testable through observables sensitive to cosmological perturbations. In this work, we use weak gravitational lensing to constrain several viable $f(R)$ gravity models. We analyze their impact on the matter power spectrum, as well as on the convergence and cosmic shear power spectra. Our analysis is carried out within a Bayesian framework using the \\textit{Cobaya} code and its modified gravity extension, \\textit{MGCobaya}, which enables consistent theoretical predictions and their comparison with current weak lensing and CMB lensing data. We find that standard cosmological parameters remain consistent with the $Λ$CDM scenario for all models considered, as expected from their background degeneracy. Nevertheless, we obtain non-trivial and model-dependent constraints on the characteristic parameters of several $f(R)$ theories."}

Assuming quasi-steady-state chemistry given the abundances of major molecules (e.g., H$_2$) from the simple network, we derive analytic solutions for molecular abundances, which reproduce the calculation results. We also calculate the molecular column densities based on the spatial distribution of tracer particles and their molecular abundances, and compare them with observations of diffuse molecular clouds. We find that the column densities of CH, CCH, and OH are linearly correlated with those of H$_2$, which supports the empirical relation used in the observations. On the other hand, the column density of HCO$^+$ shows non-linear dependence on the H$_2$ column density, reflecting the difference in HCO$^+$ formation paths in CO-poor and CO-rich regions."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z>0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations."}

The absorption profile consists of both redshifted and blueshifted components, including a newly identified blueshifted feature at -412 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. Significant SO absorption is confined to the central components, with no substantial detection toward the outer jet components. This constrains the location of SO gas to a compact region smaller than 0.45 pc in the sub-parsec vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our results support the scenario in which SO molecules are evaporated through shock heating caused by jet-torus interaction. The SO gas clumps are likely driven outward by the jet, with some returning toward the SMBH as inflowing material. Comparison with 321 GHz H2O masers reveals partial similarities in spatial distribution and radial velocity, suggesting that the jet-torus interaction may also trigger the excitation of H2O masers."}

In beyond-vacuum scenarios, the evolution of an EMRI immersed in a cold dark matter environment modifies the gravitational wave flux and introduces additional dissipative effects such as dynamical friction. In parallel, in the beyond-general relativistic settings such as in sGB gravity, the inspiraling object carries an effective scalar charge and emits scalar radiation. Both environmental and modified-gravity effects modify the flux-balance law, thereby inducing changes in the EMRI dynamics. Using a two-timescale analysis within the fixed-frequency formalism, we compute leading-order corrections to the energy fluxes for quasi-circular, equatorial orbits in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and construct the corresponding gravitational waveforms, which are used to quantify the accumulated gravitational wave dephasing and waveform mismatch relative to the vacuum general relativistic case. We further perform the Fisher Information Matrix analysis to estimate parameter correlations and the ability of future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to disentangle environmental and modified gravity effects. Our results show that both dark matter and scalar field effects can leave measurable imprints on EMRI waveforms and that a consistent beyond-vacuum treatment is essential for robust tests of gravity."}

In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics."}

We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness.

The shock cooling parameter $χ_\\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $σ_{\\rm RM}\\sim400~\\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves.

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will observe an unprecedented number density of galaxies. As a result, the majority of imaged galaxies will visually overlap, a phenomenon known as blending. Blending is expected to be a leading source of systematic error in astronomical measurements. To mitigate this systematic, we propose a new probabilistic method for detecting, deblending, and measuring the properties of galaxies, called the Bayesian Light Source Separator (BLISS). Given an astronomical survey image, BLISS uses convolutional neural networks to produce a probabilistic astronomical catalog by approximating the posterior distribution over the number of light sources, their centroids' locations, and their types (galaxy vs. star). BLISS additionally includes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct unblended galaxy profiles. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility of BLISS for cosmological applications, we apply our method to simulated single-band images whose properties are representative of year-10 LSST coadds. First, we study each BLISS component independently and examine its probabilistic output as a function of SNR and degree of blending. Then, by propagating the probabilistic detections from BLISS to its deblender, we produce per-object flux posteriors. Using these posteriors yields a substantial improvement in aperture flux residuals relative to deterministic detections alone, particularly for highly blended and faint objects. These results highlight the potential of BLISS as a scalable, uncertainty-aware tool for mitigating blending-induced systematics in next-generation cosmological surveys."}

In this work, we develop a feedforward neural network classifier that assigns to each XP spectrum a probability of being an RSG, denoted as $\\mathrm{P(RSG)}$. We perform ten independent runs with randomly divided training and validation sets, and apply each run to all XP spectra of stars with $G < 12$ mag. By selecting sources with $\\mathrm{P(RSG)} \\geq 0.9$, ten high-confidence candidate samples are obtained. A star is considered a ture Galactic RSG only if it appears in at least eight of these samples, yielding a final catalog of 2,436 objects. These RSGs show a clear spatial correlation with OB stars and trace the Galactic spiral arms well, confirming the reliability of our classification, and highlighting their potential to serve as powerful tracers of the Milky Way's structure."}

The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\\sim$5\\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts."}

Our results demonstrate a striking difference between the charm and bottom sectors: HQSS violation is negligible in the bottom system, leading to comparable peak structures for both $Z_b$ states in all hidden-bottom decay channels. In contrast, significant HQSS breaking is required to describe the $Z_c$ system, where the violation is predominantly concentrated in the elastic interactions. This explains the observed selectivity: $Z_c(3900)$ appears prominently only in $J/ψπ$, while $Z_c(4020)$ appears only in $h_cπ$. Pole analysis confirms the molecular nature of the states, with the $Z_c(4020)$ likely arising from a threshold cusp effect.

As important local characteristics of the vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The contributions in the VEVs coming from geometry with an uncompactified azimuthal coordinate are divergent, whereas the compact counterparts are finite and are analysed both numerically and asymptotically. For small values of proper radius of the compactified dimension, the leading terms of topological contributions are independent of the field mass and curvature coupling parameter, increasing by a power-law. In the opposite limit, the VEVs decay following a power-law in the general case. In the special case of a conformally coupled massless field the behavior is different. Unlike the VEV of field squared and vacuum energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses are increasing by absolute value. As a consequence, the effects of nontrivial topology are strong for the stresses in this case at small values of radial coordinate."}

We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier."}

Given a fixed angular momentum, when the spin direction is opposite to that of the angular momentum, the exponent is greater than that when the two directions are aligned.

These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner."}

We derived abundances for $α$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z (Na, Al), iron-peak (Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, V), and s-process elements (Ce) for four red giant stars observed in the H and K bands.

We detect an intrinsic C-N anti-correlation, but no Na-O or Al-Mg anti-correlations, in agreement with expectations for low-mass, metal-rich clusters. From the HST photometry, we constructed deep CMDs extending $\\sim 2-3$ magnitudes below the MSTO. This depth allowed us to provide the first robust age estimate for the cluster.

The colour excess we derived, E(B-V) = 1.08, confirms that Patchick~126 is a heavily reddened cluster, located at a heliocentric distance of 7.8 kpc. From the orbital parameters, including energy, vertical angular momentum, circularity, and maximum vertical height, we find that Patchick~126 closely follows a disc-like orbit. Taken together, these results confirm that Patchick 126 is an in situ, low-mass globular cluster of the Milky Way, exhibiting properties that lie at the boundary between old-OCs and GCs."}

This Flavour Autobiography is dedicated to my flavour collaborators", "summary": "I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics."}

A central element is simulation-based inference (SBI), which we adopt to treat uncertainties due to the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) as intrinsic non-trivial noise. By assembling a large set of bulk properties of non-rotating neutron stars across multiple state-of-the-art EOS models, we are able to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our framework further identifies the most promising parameter combinations, enabling a more focused and traditional construction of explicit universal relations. At the same time, SBI does not rely on explicit relations; instead, it directly provides predictive distributions together with a quantitative measure of systematic uncertainties, which are not captured by conventional approaches. As an example, we report a new universal relation that allows us to obtain the radius as a function of mass, fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. Our analysis shows that SBI can surpass the predictive power of this universal relation while also mitigating systematic errors. Finally, we demonstrate how universal relations can be further calibrated to mitigate systematic errors accurately."}

Here we use mm and X-ray data of $5$ X-ray binaries (XRBs) to demonstrate that these stellar-mass black holes also lie on the mm fundamental plane, as they do at radio wavelengths. One source for which we have multi-epoch observations shows evidence of deviations from the plane after a state change, suggesting that the plane only applies to XRBs in the hard state, as is true again at radio wavelengths. We show that both advection-dominated accretion flows and compact jet models predict the existence of the plane across the entire range of black hole masses, although these models vary in their ability to accurately predict the XRB black hole masses."}

By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $ρ_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs."}

Along the chiral line, the linearized mass operator develops a rank-2 Jordan block, signaling logarithmic behavior of massive modes in the dual two-dimensional CFT.

They are of particular interest because they represent a strong prediction of the LCDM model. As of today, only a handful of candidates have been observed, the most intriguing of which being Cloud-9. Using several state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to predict the abundance of dark galaxies expected within our Local Group (LG), characterise their properties and provide guidance for their potential detection. We analyse LG simulations with constrained initial conditions, run with different codes, implementing different baryonic physics, feedback prescriptions, and employing two distinct values of SF density threshold, n_th=0.13 and 10 cm^-3, to select samples of dark and bright galaxies harboured in haloes of similar mass. We demonstrate that dark galaxies exist in such simulations, though their number is larger in simulations that use a higher, more realistic n_th. These galaxies, whose gas remains diffuse and never forms stars, predominantly inhabit less-concentrated, higher-spin DM halos than their luminous counterparts. Dark galaxies are typically found in low-density regions at the outskirts of the LG, and their evolution across z indicate that both the DM and gas densities in their surroundings were consistently lower than those found around bright galaxies, making them less susceptible to interactions, mergers, or gas inflows. We estimate that up to 8 dark galaxies should be detectable in HI emission within 2.5 Mpc of the LG, with the FAST telescope, accounting for its sky coverage and minimum M_HI and N_HI. Current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, combined with upcoming HI surveys, will offer a direct and powerful test of LCDM through their ability to predict and measure properties of dark galaxies within and beyond the LG."}

These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner."}

The outer break radius can be considered as a dividing radius between the galaxy and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The values of the Rb,outer range from 0.8R_{25} to 1.45R_{25}, where R_{25} is the optical radius of the galaxy. The oxygen abundances in the CGM range from 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.0 to ~ 8.5. The O/H distribution in each of our galaxies also shows the inner break in the radial abundance profile at the radius Rb,inner. The metallicity gradient in the outer part of the galaxy is steeper than in the inner part. The behaviour of the radial abundance distributions in these galaxies can be explained by assuming an interaction with (capture of the gas from) a small companion and adopting the model for the chemical evolution of galaxies with a radial gas flow. The interaction with a companion results in the mixing of gas and a flat metallicity gradient in the CGM. The capture of the gas from a companion increases the radial gas inflow rate and changes the slope of the radial abundance gradient in the outer part of the galaxy."}

In the supersymmetric limit the theory possesses an exact PQ symmetry and a massless axion, while the inclusion of soft terms proportional to the gravitino mass induces spontaneous PQ breaking, stabilizes the saxion direction, and generates a mass for the axion. As a consequence, the axion, saxion, and axino masses are all controlled by the supersymmetry-breaking scale, leading to a correlated and predictive spectrum of axion-like states.\n  The presence of explicit soft PQ-breaking terms raises the question of vacuum alignment and CP violation. We show that although the axion mass does not originate from QCD instantons, the induced strong CP phase is parametrically suppressed by the hierarchy between the QCD-induced and soft-induced axion masses. As a result, the explicit breaking does not generate an observable CP-violating vacuum angle across the parameter space of interest.\n  We analyze the phenomenological implications of this scenario, including axion lifetimes, axion--photon couplings, and laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. Direct confrontations with beam-dump and collider searches, together with Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds, demonstrate that a substantial region of parameter space remains viable and testable. The framework thus provides a self-consistent and phenomenologically rich realization of axion-like particles whose masses arise predominantly from soft supersymmetry breaking."}

In particular, the amount of carbon relative to oxygen is known to have a strong effect on modeled abundances of many species. While previous studies have focused on comparison of modeled and observed abundances to constrain the C/O ratio, the effects of this parameter on the underlying chemistry have not been well-studied. We investigated the role of the C/O ratio on dark cloud chemistry using the NAUTILUS code and machine learning techniques for molecular representation. We find that modeled abundances are quite sensitive to the C/O ratio, especially for carbon-rich species such as carbon chains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). CO and simple ice-phase species are found to be major carbon reservoirs under both oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich conditions. The appearance of C3H4 isomers as significant carbon reservoirs, even under oxygen-rich conditions, indicates the efficiency of gas-phase C3 formation followed by adsorption and grain-surface hydrogenation. Our model is not able to reproduce the observed, gas-phase C/H ratio of TMC-1 CP at the time of best fit with any C/O ratio between 0.1 and 3, suggesting that the modeled freeze-out of carbon-bearing molecules may be too rapid. Future investigations are needed to understand the reactivity of major carbon reservoirs and their conversion to complex organic molecules."}

We study the [C II], CO(7-6), [C I](2-1), and, in SPT0418-47, $p$-H$_2$O emission, which along with the underlying continuum (rest-frame 160 $μ$m and 380 $μ$m) are routinely used as tracers of gas mass and/or star-formation rate (SFR). We perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of both sources in the image plane to study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, finding generally good agreement between the slopes of the SFR versus gas mass surface density using the different tracers. Using lens modeling methods, we find that the dust emission is more compact than the line emission in both sources, with CO(7-6) and [C I](2-1) similar in extent and [C II] the most extended, reminiscent of recent findings of extended [C II] spatial distributions in galaxies at similar cosmic epochs. We develop the [C I](2-1) / CO(7-6) flux density ratio as an observable proxy for gas depletion timescale ($τ_{\\rm dep}$), which can be applied to large samples of DSFGs, in lieu of more detailed inferences of this timescale which require analysis of observations at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore, the extended [C II] emission in both sources, compared to the total continuum and line emission, suggests that [C II], used in recent years as a molecular gas mass and SFR tracer in high-$z$ galaxies, may not always be a suitable tracer of these physical quantities."}

At level one, we find a two-parameter family of modular linear differential equation of fourth order whose solutions produce the affine characters of all elements in the magic triangle. We find a universal coset relation for the whole triangle which generalizes the dual pairs with respect to $(E_8)_1$ in the Cvitanović--Deligne exceptional series. This leads to the dimension and degeneracy of each primary field and also to five atomic models which constitute all theories in the triangle. At level two, we find a special row of the triangle -- the subexceptional series has novel $N=1$ supersymmetry, and the Neveu--Schwarz/Ramond characters satisfy a one-parameter family of fermionic modular linear differential equations.

As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup."}

The theory satisfies the requirement of causality as well. A further generalization of such a nonlocal QFT to include the gauge theories is also envisaged. In particular, dressing such a Standard Model with a CP violating phase, will make the theory satisfying most of the necessary criteria to finally explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe by a viable QFT.

Modern proofs of the GSL rely on information theoretic methods and are typically formulated using algebras of observables defined on the event horizon together with a vacuum state invariant under horizon symmetries, inducing a geometric modular flow. In this work, we formulate a dual version of the generalized second law from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity, who do not have access to the black hole area. Our approach exploits the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and of a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, in close analogy with open quantum thermodynamics. Using algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory, we analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. We show that, at null infinity, the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy, but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential takes the form of the free energy or of a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode dependent chemical potentials. The resulting inequalities define a dual generalized second law at future null infinity, which can be consistently combined with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area."}

This Flavour Autobiography is dedicated to my flavour collaborators", "summary": "I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics."}

In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics."}

For a neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed angular momentum, when the spin direction is opposite to that of the angular momentum, the exponent is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For a charged particle, after considering the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent variation with respect to the spin or angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. This result shows that the bound is violated in the spinor field."}
