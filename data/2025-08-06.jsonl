MDRC captures multi-scale features through parallel dilated\nconvolutions with varying dilation rates, while SSCA focuses on the most\nrelevant spatial regions and channel features to enhance detection accuracy and\nsuppress interference from background noise. In our experiments, the improved\nmodel outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives, improving mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) by over 14% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by approximately\n17%, demonstrating significantly improved localization accuracy for gravity\nwaves in challenging satellite imagery and contributing to more precise climate\nresearch and modeling."}

Its success depends critically on obtaining\nhighly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all\ntomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.\nHowever, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases\narising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\nutilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid\nWide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of\n$|\\Delta\\langle z \\rangle| = \\langle z_{\\text{est}} \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle\n\\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that\ndefining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift\n(spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins\nsatisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the\nphoto-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of\nten bins [$0 < z\\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the\nrealism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey\nin incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet\nthe requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography\ndefined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used\nmean spec-$z$ of SOM cells.

Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of\nweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV\nand a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce\nthe GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that\nare approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free\nextensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number,\n$U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show\nthat these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the\nobserved relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection\nconstraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing.\nThe $L_\\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\\chi\\sim\n40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment\nanomalies, $(g-2)_{\\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection\nlimits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\\sim 70-86$ GeV and a\nDM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\\tau$ and\n$L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and\nexperimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e.,\napproximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also\nmatches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by\nstrong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where\n$m_\\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the\nfew-percent level."}

Recent observational studies found\nthat dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation\nprocesses. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more\ncentrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are\nsometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex\ndynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those\ndistributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial\nconcentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to\nevaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the\nP2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can\nmix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of\ntheoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of\nbinary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models\nwith massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more\ninsights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star\nscatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation\ntimes. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial\nconditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1\nand P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser\nGCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between\nthe binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star\ninteractions seem able to explain the observable properties of some\ndynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully\nradially mixed."}

We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in\ncharacterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of\nsymmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary\ncodimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking\nadvantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice,\nwe present a number of general results for the category of topological defect\nlines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by\nstudying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models\ninfinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic\npoints in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is\ngenerated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the\nattractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological\ndefects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a\ncontinuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a\n(possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. These general results are\nconfirmed by the analysis of significant examples. We also point out the\nconnection to recent studies of topological defects in the Conway moonshine\nmodule theory (arXiv:2412.21141 [hep-th],arXiv:2504.18619 [hep-th])."}

Here, we combine dark\nmatter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus\n\"star-tagging\" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about\nthe mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized\nmeasurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar\nprofile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar \"splashback\" radii\n-- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete\nmerger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We\nfind that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time\nago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser\ndegree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters\nthat have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time.\nWe use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the\nMultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive\nto mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo\nconcentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer\nof relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL\nfeatures are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby\nclusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the\ngroundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power."}

To address these challenges, we\nutilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid\nWide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of\n$|\\Delta\\langle z \\rangle| = \\langle z_{\\text{est}} \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle\n\\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that\ndefining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift\n(spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins\nsatisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the\nphoto-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of\nten bins [$0 < z\\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the\nrealism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey\nin incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet\nthe requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography\ndefined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used\nmean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for\n$\\Omega_{\\text{m}}$, $\\sigma_{8}$, and $\\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we\nperform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift\nuncertainties.

We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame\ndataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and\nquadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift\ndependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\\Lambda$CDM model.
