Several groups have reported a\n$\\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the\nGalactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of\nweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV\nand a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce\nthe GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that\nare approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free\nextensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number,\n$U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show\nthat these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the\nobserved relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection\nconstraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing.\nThe $L_\\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\\chi\\sim\n40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment\nanomalies, $(g-2)_{\\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection\nlimits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\\sim 70-86$ GeV and a\nDM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\\tau$ and\n$L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and\nexperimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e.,\napproximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also\nmatches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by\nstrong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where\n$m_\\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the\nfew-percent level."}

These\nmodels have attracted attention due to the discovery of Mathieu moonshine\nphenomena for the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces, and have played a pivotal\nrole in extending Mukai's theorem on classification of symplectic automorphisms\nof $K3$ surfaces. We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in\ncharacterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of\nsymmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary\ncodimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking\nadvantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice,\nwe present a number of general results for the category of topological defect\nlines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by\nstudying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models\ninfinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic\npoints in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is\ngenerated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the\nattractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological\ndefects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a\ncontinuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a\n(possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. These general results are\nconfirmed by the analysis of significant examples. We also point out the\nconnection to recent studies of topological defects in the Conway moonshine\nmodule theory (arXiv:2412.21141 [hep-th],arXiv:2504.18619 [hep-th])."}

This leads us to propose a\ngeometrically motivated dyonic vector potential within the Kerr-Schild ansatz,\ndefined as a superposition of an electric contribution along the congruence and\na magnetic one that aligns to the dualized one-form. We then show that for a\nstationary and axisymmetric Kerr-Schild ansatz, the electrovac circularity\ntheorem uniquely constrains not only the scalar profile of the metric, but also\nthose associated to the electric-magnetic splitting of the gauge field. The\nresulting formalism provides a transparent derivation of the dyonic Kerr-Newman\nsolution and extends naturally to the (A)dS case, highlighting the intrinsic\ninterplay between geometry and matter in a Kerr-Schild setting."}

We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static,\nand circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair.\nAfterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further\ngeneralize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge."}
