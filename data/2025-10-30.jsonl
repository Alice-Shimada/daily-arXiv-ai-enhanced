The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales.

We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise.

Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to\nthe low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame.\nWe construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources:\n1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a\ncombination of the two.

The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales.

We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise.

We show that the screening mechanism of the asymmetron\ninside dense objects induces a surface tension associated with the boundary of\nthe screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solutions than the\nstandard Coleman-Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions are\nused to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the\ncomputation of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on\nflat planes, as well as on concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find\nthat the smallest Euclidean action occurs for bubbles nucleating along the edge\nof a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge nucleation channel with the\nbulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which concave edge\nnucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially\nsuppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of\nthe instanton approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred. This is\nlargely due to the weak couplings of the asymmetron. We apply these findings to\ndetermine the maximum curvature radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our\nresults affect the seeding of $N$-body simulations of asymmetron domains,\nshowing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the edges of\ncosmological voids.

We show that the screening mechanism of the asymmetron\ninside dense objects induces a surface tension associated with the boundary of\nthe screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solutions than the\nstandard Coleman-Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions are\nused to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the\ncomputation of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on\nflat planes, as well as on concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find\nthat the smallest Euclidean action occurs for bubbles nucleating along the edge\nof a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge nucleation channel with the\nbulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which concave edge\nnucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially\nsuppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of\nthe instanton approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred.

We apply these findings to\ndetermine the maximum curvature radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our\nresults affect the seeding of $N$-body simulations of asymmetron domains,\nshowing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the edges of\ncosmological voids.

We present\nboth analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for\nrectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest\nBorn-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the\n$QQ\\bar Q\\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a\ntetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression\nfor the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend\nthis result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the\nuniversality of the string tension."}

Our\nnumerical Monte Carlo calculations are based on a chiral lattice discretization\nof the Dirac operator, and exploit twisted volume reduction to reach $N$ as\nlarge as 841. Matching lattice data with RMT analytic results, we are able to\nextract the large-$N$ chiral condensate, which is compared with a recent\ndetermination obtained with non-chiral Wilson quarks from twisted\nvolume-reduced models."}

The high-energy post-inflationary era may\ninvolve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of\nstate (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor\nperturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial\ngravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral\ntilt ($n_{\\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the\nsubsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS\n($w<1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\\rm GW}<0$), while a stiff EoS\n($w>1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\\rm GW}>0$). In our previous work\n[arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW\nspectral energy density, $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary\ntransitions ($w_1 \\to w_2 \\to \\cdots \\to w_n \\to 1/3$), focusing on the\nparameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend\nthat framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of\ninflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories.\nRemaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral\nshapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked\nnon-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and\nduration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available\nPython package that computes $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of\nEoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion\nhistory of the Universe."}

In particular, we investigate\nthe gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the\nlight-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory.\nThrough a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge\nfixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within\nstandard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We\nthen emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard\nSynchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and\nadopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity\ndistance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen\nby a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer\nposition can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results\nvalidate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for\nevaluating cosmological observables at second order."}
