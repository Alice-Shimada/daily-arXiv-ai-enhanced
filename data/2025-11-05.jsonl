All three host rich\nmolecular gas reservoirs and show prominent Balmer absorption from $30-100$\nMyr-old stars consistent with long lasting star formation. Two systems, A1835\nand PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with\nrecent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of\nyoung stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We\nsuggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow\nthat has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy.\nThis result, combined with a companion study (arXiv:2404.02212) tracing nebular\nemission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that\nstar formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting\nfrom the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion\ninduced by feedback from the central radio jets. In RX J0820.9+0752\nintermediate age stars are found in a filament outside of the nucleus with no\ndiscernible star formation at the center of the galaxy. All projected galaxies\nare composed of old stellar populations with deep D4000 breaks and are devoid\nof detectable warm gas. While in some instances they may be interacting\ngravitationally with the central galaxy, they cannot have donated the upward of\n$10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of molecular gas found in these systems."}

The test is performed on agnostic models, where the\npostmerger signal is fitted with a superposition of damped sinusoids. If at\nleast two modes are detected, one has to compute the ratio of the frequencies\nand of the damping times and compare them against the predictions of general\nrelativity. By considering ratios, the dependency on the black hole's mass is\nscaled away. Most notably, we find that the ratios vary very little with the\nspin, the real part depends mostly on the angular momentum of the mode $\\ell$\nand the imaginary part depends mostly on the overtone number $n$: different\ncombinations create specific mode islands. We provide a qualitative explanation\nof these islands through a semi-analytical argument. We discuss the application\nof the method to future detectors. Finally, we show that ratios in alternative\ntheories of gravity or between different field content drastically differ from\nthose of general relativity."}

UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos\ndecouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d}\n\\approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann\nsuppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much\ngreater than $m_{\\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at\nfreeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for\nDM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying\nincompatibility with $\\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of\ninstantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and\naccount for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter\nspace. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo\nUFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative,\npost-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination.

Their variability\ntraces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature\nchanges, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk.\nSpurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole\nvariability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare\nby the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in\n2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical\nenergy to date is $\\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of\napproximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30\ntimes more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few\nphysical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy.\nWe discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass\n$(>30\\, M_\\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or\na supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We\nfavor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN\ndisk."}

In\nthis paper we focus more specifically on realistic ellipsoidal galaxy models.\nIt is found that how and where $b$ affects the galaxy kinematical fields is\nmainly dependent on the flattening of the stellar density distribution,\nmoderately on the presence of a Dark Matter halo, and much less on the specific\ngalaxy density profile. The main trends revealed by the numerical exploration,\nin particular the fact that more flattened systems can support larger\n$b$-anisotropy, are explained with the aid of simple ellipsoidal galaxy models,\nfor which most of the analysis can be conducted analytically.

We demonstrate that\nfits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically\npreferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also\nfind that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with\nthose of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits\nstruggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by\nlabeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr\nprograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with\nthe ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the\ndata better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When\nfitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the\ninclusion of a third mode, an ${(\\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone,\nimproves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of\ngeneral relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency\nspectrum.

We applied full spectral fitting techniques\nwith pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass\nhistories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by\nmeasuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at\ndifferent look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two\nparameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass\ndoubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star\nformation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the\nmain sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the\ngalaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back\ntimes, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends\nup in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on\ntheir current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired\ngalaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas\ngalaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR\ninitially.

The\nDyson-Schwinger equation of the quark propagator is truncated using the\nMaris-Tandy model for the dressed gluon propagator, which incorporates both the\ninfrared enhancement and the perturbatively correct ultraviolet behavior.\nAdditionally, for the dressed quark-gluon vertex, we apply its bare form and\nthe Ball-Chiu model, which minimally satisfies the constraint imposed by the\ngauge symmetry through its Ward-Green-Takahashi identity. Consistent truncation\nof both Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations requires that axial-vector\nWard-Takahashi identity, arising from chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian of\nquantum chromodynamics, must not be violated. We utilize this identity as an\nadditional constraint to truncate the Bethe-Salpeter equation and examine the\nimpact of two choices of quark-gluon vertex, along with the application of the\nMaris-Tandy model on the light meson spectrum. To extract the masses of\nflavored and unflavored light mesons, we solve the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter\nequation using the Pad$\\acute{e}$ approximation, which enables us to locate the\npoles of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude without requiring a numerical solution in\nthe timelike region of momentum space.

For\nthe Schwinger mechanism the link between the finiteness of the photon\nself-energy and the masslessness of the photon is lost. The infrared behavior\nof the fermion gap equation and the vertex equation are found to be infrared\nsafe integral equations. Moreover, by studying chiral fermions within QED it is\nobserved that the requirement of the finiteness of the photon self-energy\ntranslates into a fermion propagator that behaves as $\\slashed{p}/p^4$."}

In $\\alpha$-attractor\nmodels with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field\nfluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse\nshortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice\nsimulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of\norder tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial\ncurvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via\nHawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of\nstate and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big\nBang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new,\nefficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection\nbetween inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating."}
