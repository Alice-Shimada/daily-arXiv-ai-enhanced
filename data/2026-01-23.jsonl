Unlike traditional models, which are limited to fixed-length input sizes or configurations, OmniSpectra handles spectra of any length at their original size, without resampling or interpolation. Despite the large-scale spectroscopic data from diverse surveys fueling the rapid growth of astronomy, existing foundation models are limited to a fixed wavelength range and specific instruments. OmniSpectra is the first foundation model to learn simultaneously from multiple real-world spectra surveys with different configurations at a large scale. We achieve this by designing a novel architecture with adaptive patching across variable lengths, sinusoidal global wavelength encoding, local positional embeddings through depthwise convolution, and validity-aware self-attention masks. Allowing us to learn multi-scale spatial patterns while skipping attention for invalid patches. Even with a limited training example, OmniSpectra demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization compared to methods tailored for specific tasks. This transfer learning capability makes this model the state-of-the-art across various astronomy tasks, including source classification, redshift estimation, and properties prediction for stars and galaxies. OmniSpectra reduces the need for training individual models for different tasks from scratch, establishing itself as the next-generation astronomy foundation model."}

Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction."}

The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD."}

While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level. With the forthcoming samples from Euclid and Rubin/LSST, this approach offers a practical path to population-level inferences of halo morphology without any kinematic measurements."}

In this work, we investigate whether a similar obstruction arises when the generalized Jang equation is instead coupled to the conformal flow of metrics. Restricting to spherical symmetry and time-symmetric initial data, we formulate a numerically tractable version of the Jang/conformal flow system. Our numerical results show no evidence of a finite radius breakdown analogous to that observed by Jaracz. Instead, the Jang slope remains regular and approaches its limiting value asymptotically. This behavior persists under controlled perturbations of the warping factor, indicating robustness of the observed phenomenon. These findings suggest that coupling to conformal flow of metrics alters the obstruction mechanism present in the Jang/zero divergence system, and hence that this system may still be viable for proving the Penrose conjecture."}

We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart. We discuss the intriguing geometric understanding of such dynamical maps for the deformed theories, and also provide a concrete example for the same from a deformed string theory in flat space."}

However, their large spatial extent and intrinsically underdense environments make their identification highly sensitive to shot noise, redshift-space distortions (RSD), and observational systematics, particularly for topological and density-based void definitions. We introduce the Back-In-Time Void Finder (BitVF), a novel dynamical and physically motivated algorithm that identifies cosmic voids as regions of negative divergence of the Lagrangian displacement field reconstructed from the present-day tracer distribution. The reconstruction relies on an optimized discrete optimal transport algorithm that recovers the backward-in-time dynamics of tracers, naturally accounting for tracer bias without relying on cosmological assumptions. We validate BitVF against the widely used topological void finder REVOLVER using high-resolution N-body simulations, showing that it produces void catalogs with smoother and more physically motivated density profiles, as well as abundances that are more stable under tracer subsampling and shot noise. We further apply it to realistic DESI-like mock light-cone galaxy catalogs, demonstrating that it intrinsically mitigates redshift-space systematic effects, preserving real-space void size functions more faithfully than topological methods. Modeling RSD, the reconstruction can be combined with a fiducial cosmology and an assumed tracer bias within a bias-corrected Kaiser framework, yielding reconstructed-space void catalogs consistent with real-space statistics across redshift. Its performance is characterized as a function of the main internal parameters, showing an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to stage IV galaxy surveys. BitVF will be publicly released within the CosmoBolognaLib."}

Emerging evidence of a stellar mass dependence in the RC--SFR relation raises the broader question of how other galaxy properties may influence this relation. In this work, we study the dependence of the global RC--SFR relation on galaxy properties in local ($z\\,\\leq$\\,0.3) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). Employing a non-parametric decision-tree regression algorithm, we identify the most important galaxy properties for estimating the radio luminosity using a sample of 18,828 emission-line-classified SFGs based on spectroscopic data from the SDSS-DR8. Along with the spectroscopically obtained SFRs and stellar mass values, we also use SFRs and stellar masses derived using photometric SED-fitting from the \\textit{GALEX}--SDSS--\\textit{WISE} Legacy Catalogue (GSWLC) for the same sample. We find that a galaxy's SFR is most important for predicting the radio luminosity, followed by the stellar mass, at $>5σ$ significance. Complementing the LoTSS catalogue 150\\,MHz flux densities with aperture photometry for the rest of the emission-line classified sample (35,099 galaxies in total), we obtain a new calibration of the RC--SFR relation, which does not change significantly whether we use spectroscopic or photometrically derived SFRs and stellar masses, despite the fact that the methods probe star formation on different characteristic timescales.

We demonstrate that this morphological change fundamentally alters the shadow's topology with the topological charge flipping from 1 to -1. To analyze this topological transition, we introduce a gravitational equal-area law, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, and identify a critical point for cusp formation. Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class. These results establish a new framework for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, reframing the search for deviations from general relativity as a targeted hunt for a distinct topological and critical phenomenon."}

Specifically, violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities suggest the presence of quantum effects in macroscopic systems. Long-baseline neutrino experiments provide some of the longest available propagation distances over which such tests can be performed. Previous studies of Leggett-Garg tests in the neutrino sector have largely focused on showing that the oscillation probabilities can violate classical bounds for certain parameter choices. In this work, we develop a more complete and data-driven framework that treats both the distributions representing the classical and quantum behavior, as well as the experimental uncertainties. We consider MINOS, T2K, NOvA, as well as the upcoming DUNE, and present the respective statistical significance for distinguishing quantum behavior from classical scenarios at these long-baseline neutrino experiments. Among them, we find that T2K yields the most significant violation of classicality, at the level of $\\sim 14 σ$, with NOvA and projections for DUNE also resulting in a significance of more than $5σ$."}

The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization.

Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups.

A key prediction of these findings is that a reference frame constructed using highly photometrically variable AGN should be more stable than a frame that does not account for variability and that variability can be used to optimally weight all sources in order to maximize frame stability. Using ICRF3 matched to Gaia DR3, we employed a bootstrap method to estimate the multi-epoch stability of frames constructed using AGN selected at varying levels of photometric variability. We fit vector spherical harmonics to the coordinate differences between the three ICRF3 frames (S/X, K, and X/Ka) and Gaia and quantified the statistical dispersion as a function of blazar-like (high variability), quasar-like (low variability), and intermediate-variability class. An S/X reference frame constructed using blazars exceeds the stability of a frame constructed with quasars by a factor of 6 and is twice as stable as the ICRF3 defining sources. At K and X/Ka, a blazar-based frame matches or exceeds the stability of the defining sources by a factor of 1.4 in the case of X/Ka and exceeds the stability of a frame based on quasars by over a factor of 2 in both cases. The smaller improvement at K and X/Ka is likely because sources selected at higher frequency are more likely to be blazars. We derived a variability-based astrometric covariance scaling method that results in factor of 2 reduction in frame distortions and instabilities between S/X and Gaia, with a mild improvement for K but no difference for X/Ka, which is dominated by known distortions. Our results confirm the prediction that an optimal weighting of the link between the optical and radio celestial reference frames is enabled by accounting for photometric variability."}

In this study, we present kpc-scale polarization observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC\\,4151 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in B-array at 3 and 10 GHz. We find that the inferred magnetic (B-) field structures show a stratification: a `spine-sheath'-like structure, with fields perpendicular to the jet direction in the `spine' and parallel in the `sheath', is observed in the higher resolution (0.5 arcsec) image at 10 GHz. In addition, a `wind'-like component with B-fields perpendicular to the radio outflow is observed in the 3 GHz image (resolution 2 arcsec); this feature is prominent along the `receding' (eastern) jet direction. Rotation measure (RM) ranges from $-230$ to 250 rad m$^{-2}$ over the polarized regions, indicating a low-electron-density ($10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) tenuous medium surrounding the source causing Faraday rotation. A {tentative} RM gradient of $+75$ to $-25$ rad m$^{-2}$ is observed transverse to the northern `wind' component, while a similar gradient with opposite sign is seen across the southern `wind' component, suggestive of a helical magnetic field threading the outflow. Based on an analysis of the available radio and X-ray data, we conclude that the stratified radio outflow in NGC 4151 is magnetically-driven. The bi-conical radio `wind' is found to be massive ($1050-3200 M_\\odot$) with a high mass outflow rate ($0.01-0.03$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) but low in kinetic power ($<0.01$% of L$_{\\rm{bol}}$), making it less impactful for galactic-scale feedback.

Scattered starlight from cirrus clouds in our Galaxy poses one of the major challenges to studying the low surface brightness features of extragalactic sources. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to discriminate extragalactic sources from the cirrus cloud features. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds themselves are fundamental to understanding dust properties and the interstellar radiation field, both of which are essential for studies of chemical evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. Measuring the reddening of background sources, such as quasars, with K-DRIFT, which benefits from its broad field of view and accurate background subtraction, allows for effective detection of extended dust in galactic halos, the CGM, and intracluster space. Observations of the H-alpha emission lines can be used to identify signatures of star formation activity within galaxies, as well as the environmental effects acting on them. Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts can be traced through H-alpha emission. Strong ram pressure stripping effectively removes the interstellar medium (ISM) from galaxies. The stripped ISM becomes ionized or dissociated through mixing with the hot intracluster medium (ICM), forming H-alpha tails. The surface brightness of these H-alpha tails correlates not only with the presence of star formation in the tails but also the mixing stage of the stripped ISM and ICM. The H-alpha survey with K-DRIFT will enable the investigation of the evolutionary stages of ram pressure stripped galaxies in cluster environments, as well as the multiphase gas reservoir around galaxies and in the CGM."}

Lepton flavour violating processes are allowed at tree-level. The experimental upper bounds for the rates of the processes $τ^- \\to μ^- μ^+ μ^-$, $μ^- \\to e^- γ$, $μ^- \\to e^- e^+ e^-$ and the $ μ^- \\to e^-$ conversion in nuclei play a hierarchical role in constraining the branching fractions of lepton flavour violating $B$ and $B_s$ decays."}

The X-ray light curve exhibits a flaring period, followed by a gradual rise and decline. Throughout these events, the X-ray hardness ratio and spectrum do not change significantly. The radio flux is constant, as far as can be determined from its sparse sampling, until the end of the X-ray flare, then decreases by a factor of two by the midpoint of the gradual X-ray rise before returning to baseline at the end of the X-ray decline. We interpret this behavior in light of a similar event recently reported in NGC 2992, in which there is a temporary obscuration of the radio source by a blob of plasma ejected by a magnetic reconnection in the accretion disk. The energetics of the X-ray flare are consistent with those expected from magnetic disk activity. As in NGC 2992, the X-ray spectrum does not evolve during the obscuration event. We also discuss the possibility that the observed phenomena are due to normal AGN coronal flaring and variability, which is plausible but unlikely given the lack of spectral variation."}

We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of $H_0$ across eight bins using late-Universe probes -- Pantheon+ SNe~Ia, DESI BAO, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers -- under three cosmological frameworks: flat $Λ$CDM, CPL, and Padé cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar, low-amplitude variation in the per-bin $H_0$ estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behaviour, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about $1.71$--$1.94\\,σ$, with similar behaviour observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (SNe-only, CC-only, BAO-only) yield ratios $H_{0,i}/H_{0,\\mathrm{global}}$ mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for $\\{H_0,Ω_m,M,r_d\\}$, we find that a baseline-like oscillatory pattern re-emerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only $H_0$ is bin-dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behaviour of $H_0(z)$ in late-time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution."}

Recent JWST observations of the nearby compact group Stephan's Quintet highlight tidal flows between the interacting galaxies as well as outflows from the active galaxy NGC 7319. To study the kinematics on a large scale throughout the group, we obtained spatially-resolved long-slit spectra of Stephan's Quintet at multiple slit positions with Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph. We fit multiple Gaussians to the H$α$ $λ$6563 Å and [N II] $λλ$6548, 6583 Å emission lines to isolate the different kinematic components. We used the kinematics to develop the first biconical outflow model of the narrow-line region of NGC 7319. Using a combination of galactic rotation models, biconical outflow models, and kinematic maps of the ionized gas, we disentangled the outflows, rotation, and tidal flows in the group. We found outflow radial velocities up to 550 km s$^{-1}$ peaking at 2.6 kpc from the central supermassive black hole, and a transition from AGN-powered outflows to gravitationally-powered tidal flows at a projected distance between 2.4 -- 6.3 kpc. We performed a line ratio analysis and determined the gas shows Seyfert-like ionization out to 6.3 kpc (projected), which supports our finding that gas outside this radius is predominantly powered by tidal flows. Our separation of kinematic components in Stephan's Quintet will enable future studies of the physical conditions and dynamical forces in the ionized gas to better quantify the feeding and feedback processes of AGN in compact groups."}

Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with.

The lattice DB cohomology we construct retains many essential properties of the continuum DB cohomology and naturally incorporates a notion of self-linking number. The lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action formulated using the lattice DB cohomology is expressed as a simple quadratic form via the star product, which naturally exhibits level quantization.

Large hydrodynamic simulations are crucial for informing the alignment modelling for these surveys. We measure position-position and position-shape correlations of a Luminous Red Galaxy sample from the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, measuring the alignment signal for more than 4.9 million galaxies at redshift 0. We jointly model the clustering and alignment correlations to provide the tightest constraints on the alignment amplitude to date from a hydrodynamic simulation. We find that both the Non-Linear Alignment (NLA) and the more complex Tidal Alignment Tidal Torquing (TATT) models provide good fits to the data. We compare the measured $A_1$ amplitude to observational data and find good agreement. We measure the dependence of the NLA and TATT free parameters on halo mass. We also introduce a mass-dependent TATT model, TATT-M, by finding empirical relations between the halo mass and the TATT parameters. This allows us to fit TATT with only one parameter, $A_1$, with $A_2/A_1$ being a constant and $A_{1δ}/A_1$ being a function of halo mass. Using a Bayesian approach, we find that TATT-M is very strongly preferred by the data over NLA. Using the baryonic feedback variations of the FLAMINGO simulation suite, we test whether the TATT parameters are sensitive to feedback. Variations in AGN and supernova feedback do not significantly change the alignment amplitude beyond the change associated with the dependence of galaxy stellar mass on the strength of feedback. Our results inform the IA modelling for upcoming surveys by providing guidance on model choices, priors and sensitivities to feedback."}

To address this, we combine recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations with the SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to study the quenching of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters. We generate mock SDSS-like observations to calibrate the hot halo and cold interstellar medium (ISM) gas stripping prescriptions against observed satellite quenched fractions, finding that the previously adopted stripping prescriptions in SHARK v2.0 are too aggressive and overestimate the quenched fraction of satellite galaxies. Reducing the efficiency of both hot and cold gas stripping yields excellent agreement with observations for low- and intermediate-mass satellite galaxies. We use the calibrated model to investigate quenching timescales and find that satellites quench more quickly in clusters compared to groups, with timescales that generally decrease with increasing stellar mass. The long (>2 Gyr) timescales we measure favour hot halo gas removal as the dominant driver of satellite quenching."}

All new fields, which have nonzero charges under the non-invertible symmetry, can be dark matter candidates, since the non-invertible symmetry possesses a remnant ${Z}_2$ symmetry that plays a role in assuring the stability of our dark matter candidate. Even though the non-invertible symmetry is dynamically broken at one-loop level, its violation does not affect our scenario. In this paper, we especially consider the lightest mode of the neutral components in the doublet vector-like fermions as our main dark matter candidate. The dark matter is potentially degenerated to the other two families of neutral fermions, since the mass difference is induced at one-loop level. Thus, we consider our dark matter candidate in rather simpler co-annihilation system among their particles. Considering all the constraints of neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$ and the relic density of dark matter, we perform the numerical analysis and show some allowed regions for these phenomenology.

To fully exploit the constraining power of this dataset, our pipeline performs simultaneous multi-band modeling, using a common mass profile across all four bands while allowing independent light profiles in each. This approach leverages color information to provide joint constraints on the lens mass and yields reduced uncertainties compared to single-band analyses. Fifteen out of sixteen PISCO lens candidates are successfully recovered with interpretable lensing configurations, including DESJ0533-2536, the first reported hyperbolic-umbilic galaxy-galaxy scale strong lensing candidate. We further assess how much model complexity can be reliably constrained given the resolution and seeing of PISCO-like data. Overall, our results demonstrate that scalable, multi-band lens modeling of ground-based data can extract meaningful constraints on mass and source morphology, providing a practical pathway to maximize the scientific return from large samples in upcoming surveys."}

Our framework is designed to numerically determine a self-consistent pair of $ρ(λ)$ and $w_n$ that simultaneously satisfies these two requirements. In the concrete implementation, we employ a least-squares method, for which no sign problem arises in principle, and therefore the method can be formally applied also to Minkowski-type models.

By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $Λ$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\\pm 0.37~\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $Ω_m=0.2973\\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $σ_8 = 0.815\\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\\equivσ_8\\sqrt{Ω_m/0.3}=0.811\\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\\%$, $1.7\\%$, and $2\\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6σ$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8σ$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_ν<0.057$ eV in $Λ$CDM and $M_ν<0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date.

Scattered starlight from cirrus clouds in our Galaxy poses one of the major challenges to studying the low surface brightness features of extragalactic sources. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to discriminate extragalactic sources from the cirrus cloud features. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds themselves are fundamental to understanding dust properties and the interstellar radiation field, both of which are essential for studies of chemical evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. Measuring the reddening of background sources, such as quasars, with K-DRIFT, which benefits from its broad field of view and accurate background subtraction, allows for effective detection of extended dust in galactic halos, the CGM, and intracluster space. Observations of the H-alpha emission lines can be used to identify signatures of star formation activity within galaxies, as well as the environmental effects acting on them. Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts can be traced through H-alpha emission. Strong ram pressure stripping effectively removes the interstellar medium (ISM) from galaxies. The stripped ISM becomes ionized or dissociated through mixing with the hot intracluster medium (ICM), forming H-alpha tails. The surface brightness of these H-alpha tails correlates not only with the presence of star formation in the tails but also the mixing stage of the stripped ISM and ICM. The H-alpha survey with K-DRIFT will enable the investigation of the evolutionary stages of ram pressure stripped galaxies in cluster environments, as well as the multiphase gas reservoir around galaxies and in the CGM."}

We detail the structure of the phase diagram, with special emphasis on the finite density axis, and compute thermodynamical observables relevant for applications.

Due to the low temperatures and high densities in the centre of pre-stellar cores, the deuterium fraction is enhanced by several orders of magnitude. We study the distribution of the emission and the deuteration of the two carbon chains HC3N and CH3CCH throughout the pre-stellar core L1544. We analyse emission maps of CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CCD, HC3N, HCC13CN, and DC3N, observed with the IRAM 30m single-dish radio telescope. We use non-LTE radiative transfer calculations, combined with chemical modelling of the molecular abundances, to constrain physical parameters of the observed species. Following this, we derive the column density and deuteration maps. We find D-fractions of N(DC3N)/N(HC3N)=0.04-0.07, N(CH2DCCH)/N(CH3CCH)=0.09-0.15, and N(CH3CCD)/N(CH3CCH)=0.07-0.09. The deuteration of HC3N appears homogeneous across the core, with widespread D-fraction values above 0.06, tracing intermediate-density gas in the outer layers of the core. CH3CCD is most efficiently formed in the higher-density regions towards the core centre, while the D-fraction of CH2DCCH traces a local density enhancement in the north-east of the core, coinciding with the CH3OH emission peak. The results suggest that gas-phase reactions dominate the formation and deuteration of both HC3N and CH3CCH in L1544, with spatial variations driven by physical structure, density and external radiation. The significantly higher D-fraction of CH2DCCH compared to CH3CCD and a tentative gradient with higher values in the north suggest different deuteration mechanisms for the two functional groups. Similarities between the CH2DCCH emission and CH2DOH might indicate an additional deuteration pathway of CH3CCH on the surfaces of dust grains, as observed for H2CO."}

We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $ω^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $ω\\simeq ω_p$, or when $E_ν^{0}\\simeq m_νω/ω_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$ν$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$ν$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $φ_{\\rm d} \\sim 10^{-35}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies. Although the predicted rotation angles are below current polarimetric sensitivity, the identified spectral signatures provide a theoretical framework for probing neutrino asymmetries and AGN plasma properties independent of magnetic field models."}

Within this framework, we can investigate the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions. Compared to other approaches based on multi-parameter Ansätze of the Polyakov loop potential fixed from comparison to finite-temperature lattice data, the modeling of the glue sector in the present set-up depends on only one phenomenological parameter that can be fixed by comparison to lattice data in the vacuum. We detail the structure of the phase diagram, with special emphasis on the finite density axis, and compute thermodynamical observables relevant for applications. We also highlight the properties of the recently introduced net quark number response of the medium as a sensible probe of the phases of QCD, in particular as a tool to disambiguate the nature of certain regions of the phase diagram where the use of the Polyakov loops could lead to misinterpretations.

We first train a DDPM on radio galaxy observations from the VLA FIRST survey. We create simulated VLA, EHT, and ALMA observations of radio galaxies, then use an unsupervised posterior sampling method called Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to reconstruct the corresponding images, using our DDPM as a prior. Our approach is agnostic to the measured radio interferometric data and naturally incorporates the physics of the measurement process. We are able to reconstruct images with very high fidelity PSNR>60, a marked improvement over CLEAN and similar image reconstruction methods using conditional DDPMs"}

This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon.

With this information, we analyze the rest-frame optical redshift evolution of the effective radius and the surface luminosity density within a radius of 1 kiloparsec, $Σ_{\\text{1 kpc}}$, for 24,692 galaxies at $z>1$.

Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime.

The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities."}

Such an extension generally predicts $ρ\\neq1$, where $ρ$ is the electroweak rho parameter at the tree level, so that the renormalization of the electroweak parameters is different from models like the standard model (SM) and two Higgs doublet models. In this paper, we present a full set of radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) in this model. One-loop contributions of the extra Higgs bosons as well as SM fermions and gauge bosons to the decay rates of $h$ are calculated in the on-shell scheme. Gauge dependence appearing in the counter terms of mixing angles is eliminated by the pinch technique. Higher-order QCD corrections are also implemented. We find that the decay rates can significantly deviate from the predictions in the SM and other extensions such as the two Higgs doublet models and the singlet model. For example, the decay rates of $h\\to WW^\\ast$ and $h\\to ZZ^\\ast$ can be a few percent larger than the SM value under current experimental and theoretical constraints. In this case, deviations in $h\\to γγ$ and Higgs self-coupling can reach about $-20\\%$ and $100\\%$, respectively. The pattern of the deviations is different from the other extended Higgs models.

We analyze how the pulse asymmetry, the envelope type (Gaussian, Lorentzian and Sauter), and the carrier envelope phase jointly influence the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs. Our results show that pair production exhibits extreme sensitivity to both the degree of temporal asymmetry and the steepness of the envelope on either side of the pulse. These effects are qualitatively explained through a turning-point analysis, which, for the first time, is carried out for a non-analytic electric field using a regularization scheme. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates the Schwinger mechanism in the case of a long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-topped profile, pair production is further facilitated. We demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude by choosing certain field parameters."}

Within this sample, we identify two prominent galaxy protoclusters at $z = 3.47$ and 3.69, each anchored by massive dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). In the vicinity of these systems, we discover seven background galaxies at $z=3.6 - 6$ that simultaneously exhibit strong rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [O III] and H$α$) and unusually reddened UV-to-optical continua. We attribute this reddening to dust extinction arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the foreground DSFGs at projected separations of 7-30 kpc. We infer a high dust column density ($\\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ Msun/kpc^2), substantially exceeding those measured in low-redshift halos and those predicted by hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG and FIRE-2. The steep extinction curves, comparable to or steeper than that of the SMC, indicate a dominant population of small dust grains in the high-redshift CGM. We conclude that DSFGs at this epoch host large reservoirs of dusty CGM enriched to solar metallicity. These extended dust components are largely invisible to (sub-)millimeter interferometers such as ALMA because of their low surface brightness. We discuss the physical processes in dust transport that might be key to reproducing our observations, including galaxy mergers, cool-phase gas outflows, dust shattering, sputtering and radiation pressure. Finally, we caution that foreground CGM dust extinction may redden background galaxies at intermediate redshifts to mimic Lyman-break galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$."}

The new neutral gauge boson $Z^\\prime$ has flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. For SM allowed processes, small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found: this is a consequence of a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors preclude each other large deviations from SM.

We used \\textsc{galfit+MCMC} to fit spatial profiles in 7 wide-band images and detected extended emission in 9 sources out of 17. The close spatial alignment between the extended components and the AGN centers indicates that this emission likely originates from the host galaxies. These sources are extended at 0.9--2.0~$μ$m, suggesting significant host-galaxy light in the rest-frame UV. For the sources with the host detection, the stellar mass inferred based on image decomposition result can be 1-2 dex lower than the results without image decomposition.

We analyze how the pulse asymmetry, the envelope type (Gaussian, Lorentzian and Sauter), and the carrier envelope phase jointly influence the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs. Our results show that pair production exhibits extreme sensitivity to both the degree of temporal asymmetry and the steepness of the envelope on either side of the pulse. These effects are qualitatively explained through a turning-point analysis, which, for the first time, is carried out for a non-analytic electric field using a regularization scheme. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates the Schwinger mechanism in the case of a long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-topped profile, pair production is further facilitated. We demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude by choosing certain field parameters."}

As spatially resolved SED modeling becomes feasible for large high-redshift samples, it is increasingly important to assess how dust attenuation affects resolved mass estimates. We evaluate the impact of dust attenuation on stellar mass estimates derived from integrating spatially resolved SED fitting results. We perform spatially resolved and integrated SED fitting on a sample of 3408 galaxies at $3 \\leq z < 9$ from the GOODS South field, combining deep NIRCam from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and HST/ACS imaging from GOODS and CANDELS. We compare galaxy-integrated properties derived from fitting the summed SED with those obtained from spatially resolved SED modeling. Using a two-component dust attenuation model with a variable slope, we investigate how the dust attenuation slope, A(V), and stellar population properties contribute to discrepancies in the resulting stellar mass estimates. Resolved stellar masses are systematically higher than integrated estimates, with a median offset of +0.24 dex. Resolved analyses recover higher dust attenuations ($ΔA(V)\\approx +0.08$ mag), lower birth cloud fractions ($Δμ\\approx -0.28$), and grayer attenuation curves ($Δδ_{\\mathrm{ISM}} = +0.08$), arising from preferential sampling of compact star-forming regions.

The stellar mass offset correlates strongly with the age difference and the attenuation slope difference, indicating that age-dependent outshining and spatially varying dust geometry are primary drivers of the discrepancy between resolved and integrated stellar masses."}

We detect the temperature-sensitive [OIII]4363 auroral line in 40 galaxies in our sample, affording $T_e$-based abundances for this subset. We find that the average N/O abundance ratio in our low-metallicity sample is at least 0.1 dex higher than z ~ 0 samples. In particular, we find significant scatter toward high N/O, with five galaxies being identified with enhanced nitrogen abundances (log(N/O)>-1.1) at low-metallicity (12+log(O/H)<8.0) from $T_e$-based measurements. Meanwhile, applying strong-line abundance measurements to the remainder of our sample reveals a further 14 candidate galaxies passing these abundance cuts, implying that around 13 % of 12+log(O/H)<8.0 galaxies at these redshifts are nitrogen-enhanced at this level. We find that N/O abundance in low-metallicity systems correlates with SFR, surface density of SFR, and surface density of stellar mass at high redshift, while only in high-metallicity systems does a correlation with stellar mass emerge. Despite healthy representation of these `moderately nitrogen-enhanced' galaxies (-1.1<log(N/O)<-0.6), no galaxies in our low-metallicity sample are identified as having log(N/O)>-0.6, abundances that are typical of high-redshift NIII]- and NIV]-emitters. This demonstrates that the extreme nitrogen enhancements seen in some NIII]- and NIV]-emitters are only attained during the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that these elevated abundances are caused by enrichment from young massive stars in extreme environments and that the impact of this enrichment pathway is milder, though still important, for high-redshift systems on the star-forming main sequence."}

We analyse L, C and X-band images (from 1.4 to 12 GHz) of the LINER NGC4438, combining high-resolution data from enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) and Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).

This interaction drives shock-ionised gas, produces a moderate velocity outflow that removes material from the region, and generates thermal X-ray emission coincident with the radio and H$α$ cavity."}

With current challenges in measuring halo properties, the stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation is introduced as an alternative metric sensitive to the dark matter content within galaxies. We explore how spatially resolved stellar population properties vary across this relation using optical IFS data and photometry from 265 CALIFA galaxies. Spatially resolved ages and metallicities, [M/H], are derived using a Bayesian framework fed with a library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuation. We study these properties in terms of both stellar and total dynamical mass, with the latter being enclosed mass within three effective radii from Jeans dynamical modeling. We find that ages and [M/H] measured at different annuli depend on both stellar and total mass, yet showing distinct radial trends. While the dependence of age on total mass is more prominent in the outskirts, that of [M/H] is significant in the inner parts. This behavior is reflected in the stellar population profiles and gradients, more strongly for age and connected to morphology. Intermediate-mass early-types have higher stellar-to-total mass ratios and flatter age profiles with older ages, and steep negative [M/H] profiles, whereas later-types have lower stellar-to-total mass ratios, negative age profiles with younger ages and shallower negative [M/H] profiles. Moreover, at fixed stellar mass galaxies have more negative age gradients and shallower [M/H] ones as total mass increases. Our results show that total dynamical mass is linked to systematic variations in stellar populations and radial gradients at fixed stellar mass, suggesting a relevant role of dark matter halos in shaping galaxy properties"}

Our gas mass measurements are derived from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 long-baseline observations of CO(J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum emission at 14-20 pc resolution, which probes below the resolving limit of the previous black hole mass measurements. Subtracting molecular gas mass from these enclosed masses is not enough to reconcile with BH-galaxy relationships, but independently measuring M$_\\mathrm{enc}$ using the cold CO(2-1) gas does shift the black holes down to their expected values. Still, these ALMA data reveal respective molecular gas masses of $\\sim$3$\\times$10$^7$ to $\\sim$6$\\times$10$^8$ M$_\\odot$ within 70 pc of these black holes, which could challenge some black hole accretion models that assume nuclear gas like this has no angular momentum."}

LaTeX. Submitted to MNRAS. Implementation will be included in the JamPy package at https://pypi.org/project/jampy/", "summary": "Dynamical modelling is a fundamental tool for measuring galaxy masses and density profiles in the era of large integral-field spectroscopic surveys and Bayesian inference. Solutions based on the Jeans equations are popular due to their robustness and computational efficiency. However, traditional semi-analytic Jeans solvers often require restrictive assumptions about the velocity anisotropy to remain computationally tractable. This paper presents a new spectral solver for the axisymmetric Jeans equations designed to overcome these limitations. I first illustrate, using orbit integrations in realistic potentials, that spherical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is a physically well-motivated approximation for galaxy modelling. The new method employs a spectral technique to solve the Jeans partial differential equations directly. Two design choices are critical for accuracy and speed: (i) solving for the slowly-varying velocity dispersion rather than the rapidly varying pressure, and (ii) imposing a Robin boundary condition to enforce the asymptotic decay on a finite domain. This formulation supports arbitrary anisotropy distributions beta(r, theta) while simultaneously increasing computational speed by orders of magnitude compared to standard high-accuracy quadratures. Validated against exact analytic benchmarks, the solver recovers intrinsic moments with sub-percent accuracy. The implementation will be included in the public JamPy package and is structured to be optimally suited for massive parallelization on specialized hardware such as GPUs, enabling the rigorous exploration of complex parameter spaces."}

We explore whether this could be due to tidal stripping by the central black hole. This requires putting the stars onto highly eccentric orbits, for which we evaluate diffusion by both scalar resonant and non-resonant relaxation of the orbital angular momentum. We conclude that tidal stripping does not discriminate sufficiently between main-sequence and red giant stars. While the tidal loss cone increases with stellar radius, the rate of diffusion into the loss cone increases only logarithmically, whereas the lifetime on the red giant branch decreases more rapidly than $R_*^{-1}$. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stellar collisions are a more likely explanation for the deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter ones."}

They often appear in certain regions of the detectors and contaminate observations at surface-brightness levels relevant for faint-source photometry. We introduce a new subtraction method that uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to model and remove wisps. Using deep NIRCam observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and other programs, we construct multi-component, filter- and detector-specific wisp templates that capture the wisp structures and their exposure-to-exposure morphological variations. Wisps in individual exposures are represented as non-negative linear combinations of these templates, consistent with their additive nature and reducing degeneracies relative to single-template scaling. Compared to existing approaches, our method delivers lower residual root mean square in wisp-affected regions and reduces photometric bias and scatter to levels consistent with clean detector areas. The NMF wisp templates are readily applicable to other datasets and are publicly released to support future NIRCam extragalactic surveys."}
