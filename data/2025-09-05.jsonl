Focal plane wavefront sensing and control\nallows us to detect, and subsequently remove, time-varying speckles through\nmeasurements of the electric field. Two measurement-based wavefront sensing\napproaches are pairwise probing (PWP) and the self-coherent camera (SCC).\nHowever, the PWP technique is time-consuming, requiring at least 4 images and\nreducing the speed at which aberrations can be eliminated.

The SCSCC utilizes a pinhole\nplaced closer to the Lyot Stop, reducing the overall beam footprint and\nboosting the sensor resolution. A knife-edge beam splitter downstream of the\nLyot Stop splits the light into two channels: fringed and unfringed. This\nallows us to sense the wavefront with a single exposure.

The exact optimal number varies with galaxy complexity:\ndisk-dominated galaxies require 12 features, bulge-dominated galaxies need 9,\nand intermediate systems require 10-11 features. Correlations between extracted\nPCA features and structural measurements reveal that the VAE prioritizes galaxy\nsize during reconstruction, with half-light radius strongly correlating with\nthe highest-ranked principal components. Subsequent features capture\nmorphology-dependent characteristics: disk-dominated galaxies emphasize size,\nasymmetry, and position angle; bulge-dominated systems focus on size,\nconcentration, and axis ratio; while intermediate galaxies show enhanced\nattention to S\\'ersic index, indicating greater emphasis on accurately\nreproducing both disk and bulge structures. The PCA process significantly\nreduces the entanglement of the features compared to the raw VAE latent\nfeatures, decreasing the correlations with the half-light radius and the\nS\\'ersic index from 14.5\\pm1.0 and 6.0\\pm1.5 features, respectively, to only\n2.0\\pm1.0 components after PCA.

The main goal of this work is to derive\nmodel-independent constraints on the Hubble parameter up to $z \\sim 0.4$ using\nstellar ages from the fitting of Lick index absorption lines in passively\nevolving galaxies. Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite\ndifferences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe\nat an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in\nterms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk\n($j_0$) parameters. We carefully select spectra of massive and passively\nevolving galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey. After applying a stacking\nprocedure to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio, the strength of Lick indices\nis fit using two stellar population models (TMJ and Knowles) to derive stellar\npopulation parameters. A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed,\nwhich in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the\nconsidered redshift range. The baseline result comes from using the\nTMJ-modelled ages, and it yields a value of $H_0 = 70.0^{+4.1}_{-7.6} \\text{ km\ns}^{-1} \\text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant, where uncertainties refer\nonly to the statistical treatment of the data. The sampling of the Hubble\nparameter at $0.05 < z < 0.35$ is competitive with discreet model-independent\nmeasurements from the literature.

We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE),\na new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice\nabsorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice\nfractional composition in terms of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$,\n$\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\\mathrm{CH_4}$.

Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional\ncomputer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR\nabsorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\\sim$3 $\\%$ in the species\nfraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38\nand J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program,\ndemonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice\ncomposition.
