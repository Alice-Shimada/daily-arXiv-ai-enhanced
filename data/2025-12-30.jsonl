Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires \"moderate\" parameter tuning."}

A systematic comparison between SU(3) and SU(4) configurations is provided. It has been found that the estimations of meson masses derived from SU(4) eLSM are more congruent with experimental values than those derived from SU(3) eLSM. Consequently, we conclude that an increase in quark degrees of freedom significantly enhances the accuracy of meson mass simulations. We investigate the effect of temperature on the masses of various meson states calculated in the SU(3) and SU(4) eLSM. After establishing all the fitting parameters, the temperature dependence of meson masses shows that although various meson states exhibit unique patterns in their mass changes with temperature, they all seem to share a similar range of dissolution temperatures. This means that the critical temperature that marks the phase transition from hadrons to quarks appears to vary slightly depending on the meson states. In this regard, we find that the quarkonium states, formed by a quark and its antiquark, are largely unaffected by variations in the temperature."}

Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_πL \\lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data.

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations."}

Stacking analyses coadd cutouts of LIM data on positions of known signal emitters, robustly detecting signal otherwise hidden in a noisy map. In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias."}

To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc).

A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts.

In the charged lepton sector an approximate triality symmetry arises in the seesaw limit, suppressing muon flavour-violating processes and allowing only specific $τ$ decay channels. The model provides a tightly constrained and experimentally testable framework linking neutrino masses, lepton mixing and lepton-number-violating observables."}

In addition, each time the kink crosses the wormhole throat, it emits scalar wave packets, causing its oscillation amplitude to gradually decrease. Our results reveal how the wormhole geometry influences the motion of defects and their energy transfer, providing new insights into the dynamics of topological defects in exotic spacetime."}

We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS.

Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions."}

Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture."}

The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $σ(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $β(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number."}

The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission."}

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system."}

One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer.

UGC 694 exhibits a heliocentric velocity of 12683 +/- 34 km/s, placing it at a distance of approximately 188 Mpc, whereas IC 412 is located in the foreground at approximately 62 Mpc with a velocity of 4311 +/- 46 km/s.

Furthermore, we utilize differential photometry to analyze the structural asymmetry and color distribution of UGC 694. Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions.

Its influence on their propagation is typically encoded in a single medium function, the dipole cross section. Its small distance behavior is characterized by the jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$, and we obtain its numerical value throughout the pre-equilibrium stage, finding values comparable in magnitude to the earlier Glasma stage. We also compute the more general elastic collision kernel, obtained by Fourier transforming the dipole cross section. This constitutes an important step to facilitate the understanding of jet-medium interactions during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Additionally, we improve QCD kinetic theory simulations by employing a more realistic (HTL) screening mechanism to incorporate medium effects, which we compare with simpler screening mechanisms. An expanding plasma realized in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions exhibits a significantly reduced maximum anisotropy and reduced specific shear viscosity $η/s$ when using the improved screening prescription. Moreover, we investigate the gluon splitting rates, which are typically obtained using an isotropic model for the collision kernel. Going beyond that approximation, we find that the splitting rates obtained from the nonequilibrium anisotropic kernel differ significantly both in magnitude and in their qualitative time evolution. We further identify a novel type of weak-coupling attractor, which can be observed in the ratio of the jet quenching parameter and pressure ratio, and is obtained by extrapolating to vanishing coupling. This improved kinetic theory description and novel limiting attractors contribute towards a more realistic modeling of the nonequilibrium QCD plasma and its equilibration and hydrodynamization process during the initial stages."}

Such objects require regions of negative energy density -a condition typically regarded as unphysical within the context of conventional stellar models. Nevertheless, negative energy densities arise naturally in traversable wormhole geometries, where the violation of the null energy condition is essential to sustain the flaring-out behavior at the throat. This connection suggests that ghost-like configurations may find a natural realization within wormhole physics. In this work, we investigate the existence of ghost configurations by analyzing their associated Hawking mass. Although in spherical symmetry the Misner and Hawking masses are known to coincide, we show that when the ghost condition is extended beyond spherical symmetry and applied to the Hawking mass, it faces topological obstructions that hinder its straightforward realization. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that a Casimir-like traversable wormhole can be naturally constructed within this framework. Finally, to illustrate the properties of the resulting geometry, we analyze its Penrose-Carter diagram."}

For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters.

We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \\texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \\texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \\equiv Υ/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency.

Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities > -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i > 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li.

Processing radio interferometric data often requires storing forward-predicted model data. In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression.

TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{sSFR}\\simeq-14.85$ ($\\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{sSFR}\\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\\star\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts. All catalogues and analysis scripts are publicly released."}

By introducing a non-minimal coupling between a bulk scalar field and the Ricci scalar, we obtain analytic solutions under a flat, four-dimensional Poincaré-invariant metric with a kink-like scalar configuration. The warp factor exhibits a bell-shaped profile, while the scalar potential forms a symmetric volcano-like structure, characteristic of a finite-thickness brane. The corresponding energy density is regular and localized, featuring a central peak with symmetrically placed negative minima. Through the analysis of linear tensor perturbations, we derive a Schrödinger-like equation with supersymmetric factorization, ensuring the absence of tachyonic modes and thus the stability of the background configuration. The effective potential also takes a volcano-like form that supports a localized graviton zero mode, confirming the recovery of four-dimensional gravity on the brane. A numerical study of the massive Kaluza--Klein spectrum reveals the progressive delocalization of massive modes into the bulk.\n  Our results demonstrate a stable and physically consistent thick brane configuration within the Palatini gravity framework, offering new insights into gravity localization and braneworld phenomenology."}

In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector."}

This version is related to the species scale as a new cutoff in quantum gravity, and we study whether stringy modes remain stringy and never exceed the Hubble horizon. The refined TCC predicts a shorter lifetime for de-Sitter spacetime and imposes a bound on the cosmological constant. We present supporting evidence for the refined TCC from cosmological solutions of different compactifications of various string theories. Furthermore, it is argued that both the TCC and the refined TCC are incompatible with the big-bang singularity. Therefore, if the TCC and the refined TCC hold, the big bang singularity must be ruled out. In scenarios such as string gas cosmology, where the TCC is realized, the spacetime background remains completely regular."}

We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations."}

When the scalar potential vanishes, scalar-hairy black holes emerge with profiles and properties similar to those observed in flat spacetime. The presence of the scalar potential additionally induces tachyonic-hairy solutions, leading to the coexistence of these two distinct hairy phases in different regions of the parameter space. The phase diagram reveals a first-order phase transition line between the tachyonic-hairy and scalar-hairy phases, originating at a critical point in the extreme temperature and chemical potential regime. Our detailed analysis shows that this phase transition is directly associated with the self-overlap region of the scalar-hairy phase and its start point.

We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias."}

In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Padè-Borel and Padè-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime. In the scalar case, it yields only marginal improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients. This work establishes a natural completion of the resurgence programme for constant electromagnetic backgrounds, providing a robust analytic framework for exploring nonperturbative physics and strong-field phenomena in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, from finite perturbative data."}

The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $Φ_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $ρ_b$ generates an additional energy density $ρ_s = μ_s Φ_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $Φ_{\\rm tot}$, \\[ \\nabla^2Φ_{\\rm tot} = 4πG\\,ρ_b /c^2 + 4πG\\,μ_s\\,Φ_b^2 / c^6. \\] When assuming $μ_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied."}

We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations."}

A major source of this ambiguity lies in the common practice of treating the angular momentum of test particles as a freely adjustable parameter, rather than a quantity fixed by the circular-orbit conditions. In this work, we develop a fully constrained framework in which the angular momentum of particles is determined exactly from the underlying geometry and is used consistently in both the orbital and Lyapunov analyses. For the charged Kiselev black hole, previously reported chaos-bound violations disappear under a consistent treatment of angular momentum, indicating that these effects are apparent rather than physical. This inference is reinforced by the exact agreement between our results and the standard circular-orbit condition obtained from the effective-potential approach. By extending the analysis to geometries containing higher-order curvature terms, we find genuine chaos-bound violations at large charge-to-mass ratios, originating from curvature corrections rather than orbital parameters. This framework, therefore, provides a systematic means of distinguishing apparent from physical chaos-bound violations in Einstein gravity and its extensions."}

Candidate Selection from Chandra with Random Forest", "comment": "ApJ, submitted", "summary": "Quasar samples remain severely incomplete at low Galactic latitudes because of strong extinction and source confusion. We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|<20°, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs."}

After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide."}

We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range.

The construction relies on fixing the residual conformal Killing group using a mostly BRST-exact operator that has been successfully applied in the open-string case. Earlier attempts at a straightforward extension to closed strings--treating them naïvely as products of open strings--fail. Nevertheless, we show that a consistent prescription can be obtained by replacing the open-string BRST charge with the closed-string BRST charge. The key idea is to employ closed-string vertex operators with nonstandard ghost-number assignments, rather than the conventional ghost-number (1,1) vertices. Furthermore, since the pure spinor BRST cohomology for closed strings vanishes at total (left plus right) ghost number four or higher, we find that the resulting prescription is essentially unique."}

We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\\ell\\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-δ})$, $k=O(r^{-2-δ})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong."}

Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \\pm 0.060 - (0.107 \\pm 0.022)\\,E(G_{\\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands."}

The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $Φ_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $ρ_b$ generates an additional energy density $ρ_s = μ_s Φ_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $Φ_{\\rm tot}$, \\[ \\nabla^2Φ_{\\rm tot} = 4πG\\,ρ_b /c^2 + 4πG\\,μ_s\\,Φ_b^2 / c^6. \\] When assuming $μ_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database.

The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential.

The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation."}

As the deformation parameter increases, the polarization intensity decreases monotonically when the magnetic field lies in the equatorial plane, whereas it does not vary monotonically when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The variation of the electric vector position angle with the deformation parameter is complex. For a fixed deformation parameter, the polarization intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the spin parameter and varies with azimuthal angle. We also investigate the impact of the deformation parameter on the Stokes Q-U loops.

In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers.

In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to polarisation and spin correlations in the $\\bar q q \\to τ^+ τ^-$ production processes, with $τ$ decays included. Because of the complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighing with studied New Physics phenomena. Extensions of the Standard Model spin amplitudes, within Improved Born Approximation used for matrix element, are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with $τ$ dipole and weak dipole moments in mind, but is applicable to arbitrary New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into the Standard Model $2 \\to 2$ structure of matrix element extensions. Implementation allows one also to introduce arbitrary phase-shift between vector and axial-vector couplings of $Z$ boson to $τ$ leptons, which would have impact on observed transverse spin correlations. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, together with distributions for spin correlation matrix. Numerical examples of impact on experimental signatures are shown in case of $τ^\\pm \\to ρ^\\pm ν_τ\\to π^\\pm π^0 ν_τ$ decays.

I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter.

The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schrödinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes."}

We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $ξ$ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $ξ$ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $ξ$ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $Ω$, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $ξ$ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% Ω$ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH."}

The multipole expansion of each body's center-of-mass acceleration is derived, and the expansion comprises the Coulomb-type part and the Yukawa-type part, where the former, identical to that in General Relativity, is encoded by the products of the mass multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies, and the latter, as the modification introduced by $f(R)$ gravity, is encoded by the products of the scalar multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies. As an essential component of the system's orbital dynamics, the multipole expansion for the total gravitational potential energy is provided, and the expression for the total conserved energy in terms of the mass and scalar multipole moments of the bodies is offered. To investigate the system's spin dynamics, the equation of motion for each body's spin angular momentum is further deduced and presented in the form of multipole expansion. These findings constitute the main content of the coarse-grained description of inter-body dynamics for the system within the framework of the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. As a by-product, for a two-body system, the effective one-body equation governing the relative motion between the two bodies and the total energy of this system are achieved."}

As a result, a set of algebraic properties for certain hypergeometric functions is derived, allowing us to initiate the algebraic study of special functions directly via stress-tensor deformations and massive gravity. Moreover, we sharpen the connection between the trace-flow equation and the local renormalization group in any dimension. In $d>2$, the usual initial condition for the coupling leads to a potential known as ghost-free, minimal massive gravity. Upon expansion around the reference background, we retrieve Fierz-Pauli at leading order, matching the random geometry and holographic approaches.

Derrick's scaling relation provides a global integral constraint on these profiles, but reveals nothing about the local balance between kinetic and potential contributions in different regions. We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $α$ that controls the radial weighting: negative $α$ emphasizes the core where topological boundary conditions are imposed, large positive $α$ emphasizes the asymptotic tail, and $α= 1$ recovers the classical Derrick relation. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $α$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $α$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $α$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $α$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $α$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales."}

This limitation can be alleviated by introducing a dimension-5 Higgs-portal operator in the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM model and/or by modifying the standard cosmological history of the Universe. In this article, we analyze complex scalar DM production in both the reheating and radiation-dominated epochs within an effective field theory (EFT) framework. While both scenarios exhibit sizeable regions of parameter space consistent with existing constraints, freeze-out during reheating opens up additional viable regions that are otherwise ruled out by DM overabundance in the radiation-dominated scenario. Notably, the renormalizable Higgs-portal coupling is constrained by relic density, direct- and indirect-detection limits, whereas the EFT coupling associated with the dimension-5 operator is constrained by relic density and indirect-detection bounds arising from DM semi-annihilation. We further study the production cross section of complex scalar DM at hadron and lepton colliders."}

As the modification parameter $α$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $α$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $α$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds."}

As an important consequence of the spontaneous breaking of both the $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries by electroweak vacuum expectation values, upper limits appear on masses of an additional gauge boson $Z'$ and extra Higgs bosons which are less than the TeV scale. In addition, the standard model (SM) like Higgs boson $h$ and a heavier Higgs boson $H$ mainly decay into a pair of $Z'$ which induces four lepton final states. These new decay modes cannot be suppressed by taking no $Z$-$Z'$ mixing and/or the Higgs alignment limit. We find that the minimum setup of these 2HDMs has been excluded by current data for four lepton searches at LHC. Such severe constraints can, however, be avoided by introducing a pair of vector-like fermions $χ$ which are singlet under the SM symmetry but charged under $U(1)_X$, and can be a candidate of dark matter. Thanks to the existence of $χ$, $Z'$ can mainly decay into $χ\\barχ$ instead of SM leptons.

Specifically, each choice of path-integral measure in the definition of the wavefunction path integral uniquely determines an operator ordering and hence a corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

Invited contribution to QCD at the Extremes (QCDEX2025)", "summary": "Virtuality and coherence determine the limits of applicability of holographic concepts in QCD. In light-front quantization, the invariant mass controls the off-shell behavior of a physical process and thus provides a measure of its virtuality. In impact space, the corresponding quantity is the invariant transverse separation between quarks and gluons, $ζ$, which is identified with the holographic coordinate $z$ in holographic light-front QCD. By embedding the internal structure of hadrons and implementing an effective superconformal symmetry, the mapping between quantum states and classical gravity --central to the holographic principle-- yields new analytic insights into the strong-interaction dynamics responsible for the emergence of a confinement scale and the observed hadron spectrum. We show that the possible emergence of a gravity dual to physical QCD is restricted to the Regge limit of high-energy scattering, where many partonic degrees of freedom participate coherently. This criterion provides a quantitative definition of the domain of applicability of holographic QCD to dynamical processes and allows it to be tested directly against experimental results. By further enforcing analyticity together with exact QCD constraints at asymptotic infinity, the holographic framework can be consistently extended beyond the infrared domain. To illustrate this procedure, we briefly discuss recent work by the HLFHS collaboration, where the effective strong coupling was extended from the Regge-limit domain, through the near-perturbative transition region, and into the ultraviolet Bjorken-limit domain. The resulting scheme provides a unified and precise nonperturbative description of the strong coupling across all virtuality scales."}

The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves.

A major source of this ambiguity lies in the common practice of treating the angular momentum of test particles as a freely adjustable parameter, rather than a quantity fixed by the circular-orbit conditions. In this work, we develop a fully constrained framework in which the angular momentum of particles is determined exactly from the underlying geometry and is used consistently in both the orbital and Lyapunov analyses. For the charged Kiselev black hole, previously reported chaos-bound violations disappear under a consistent treatment of angular momentum, indicating that these effects are apparent rather than physical. This inference is reinforced by the exact agreement between our results and the standard circular-orbit condition obtained from the effective-potential approach. By extending the analysis to geometries containing higher-order curvature terms, we find genuine chaos-bound violations at large charge-to-mass ratios, originating from curvature corrections rather than orbital parameters. This framework, therefore, provides a systematic means of distinguishing apparent from physical chaos-bound violations in Einstein gravity and its extensions."}

At present, the evidence has the form of a double-copy relation for string-amplitude building blocks, which are combined using the multiple-polylogarithm (MPL) generating functions. These generate MPLs relevant for all-order AdS curvature corrections of four-point string amplitudes. In this paper, we prove this building-block double copy using a new, noncommutative version of twisted de Rham theory. In flat space, the usual twisted de Rham theory is already known to be a natural framework to describe the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) double-copy map from open- to closed-string amplitudes, in which the KLT kernel can be computed from the intersections of the open-string amplitude integration contours. We formulate twisted de Rham theory for noncommutative-ring-valued differential forms on complex manifolds and use it to derive the intersection number of two open-string contours, which are closed in the noncommutative twisted homology sense. The inverse of this intersection number is precisely the AdS double-copy kernel for the four-point open- and closed-string generating functions."}

It has been found that the estimations of meson masses derived from SU(4) eLSM are more congruent with experimental values than those derived from SU(3) eLSM. Consequently, we conclude that an increase in quark degrees of freedom significantly enhances the accuracy of meson mass simulations. We investigate the effect of temperature on the masses of various meson states calculated in the SU(3) and SU(4) eLSM. After establishing all the fitting parameters, the temperature dependence of meson masses shows that although various meson states exhibit unique patterns in their mass changes with temperature, they all seem to share a similar range of dissolution temperatures. This means that the critical temperature that marks the phase transition from hadrons to quarks appears to vary slightly depending on the meson states. In this regard, we find that the quarkonium states, formed by a quark and its antiquark, are largely unaffected by variations in the temperature."}

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system."}

We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations."}

In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Padè-Borel and Padè-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime. In the scalar case, it yields only marginal improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients.

We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $ξ$ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $ξ$ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $ξ$ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $Ω$, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $ξ$ itself, becomes important near such regions.

We show that, upon canonical quantization of the Hamiltonian, only a restricted subset of operator orderings is consistent with the path-integral viewpoint. Remarkably, all consistent orderings are physically equivalent to all orders in $\\hbar$. Specifically, each choice of path-integral measure in the definition of the wavefunction path integral uniquely determines an operator ordering and hence a corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The consistent orderings are in one-to-one correspondence with the Jacobians associated with all field redefinitions of a set of canonical degrees of freedom. For each admissible operator ordering--or equivalently, each path-integral measure--we identify a definite, positive Hilbert-space inner product. All such prescriptions define the same quantum theory, in the sense that they lead to identical physical observables. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to the Starobinsky model."}

We have used the more complete Wetterich equation, which includes gravitational couplings in a systematic way from the start, to understand the emergence of this phase. The singular structure of the RG flows has persisted on including gravitational-couplings, thereby offering further support to the conjecture that \\cPT -symmetric phases of (repulsive) gravity characterise string-effective CS gravitational theories, where the axion is the massless string-model independent axion, which can also play a role of a totally-antisymmetric torsion degree of freedom. This has suggested a novel interpretation of the currently observed acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in terms of such a phase at large (cosmological) scales."}

Within the semiclassical approximation, we study configurations describing a bubble of true vacuum propagating outside a black hole formed from gravitational collapse. We find that the saddle point is dominated by a single energy state and that the dependence on the initial conditions in the stellar interior vanishes exponentially fast at late stages of the collapse. Prescriptions are given for implementing the corresponding boundary conditions in the eternal black-hole geometry. We find that vacuum decay can only be weakly catalyzed by the black hole, as the suppression exponent attains a minimum at a finite black-hole mass. In the limit of vanishing black-hole mass, the suppression smoothly approaches the flat-space result."}

Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $α$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $α$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $α$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds."}

The method is tested on a simple (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions, where our method precisely reproduces the full quantum spectral functions calculated using exact numerical diagonalization in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD deep in the deconfinement regime."}

We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band."}

In particular, we discuss how it is possible to construct expressions which do not receive quantum corrections in all orders for certain ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. For instance, in ${\\cal N}=1$ SQED+SQCD there is a renormalization group invariant combination of two gauge couplings. For the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model there are two such independent combinations of the gauge and Yukawa couplings. We investigate the scheme-dependence of these results and verify them by explicit three-loop calculations. We also argue that the all-loop exact $β$-function and the corresponding renormalization group invariant can exist in the $6D$, ${\\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric higher derivative gauge theory interacting with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation."}

To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry."}

Invited contribution to QCD at the Extremes (QCDEX2025)", "summary": "Virtuality and coherence determine the limits of applicability of holographic concepts in QCD. In light-front quantization, the invariant mass controls the off-shell behavior of a physical process and thus provides a measure of its virtuality. In impact space, the corresponding quantity is the invariant transverse separation between quarks and gluons, $ζ$, which is identified with the holographic coordinate $z$ in holographic light-front QCD. By embedding the internal structure of hadrons and implementing an effective superconformal symmetry, the mapping between quantum states and classical gravity --central to the holographic principle-- yields new analytic insights into the strong-interaction dynamics responsible for the emergence of a confinement scale and the observed hadron spectrum. We show that the possible emergence of a gravity dual to physical QCD is restricted to the Regge limit of high-energy scattering, where many partonic degrees of freedom participate coherently. This criterion provides a quantitative definition of the domain of applicability of holographic QCD to dynamical processes and allows it to be tested directly against experimental results. By further enforcing analyticity together with exact QCD constraints at asymptotic infinity, the holographic framework can be consistently extended beyond the infrared domain. To illustrate this procedure, we briefly discuss recent work by the HLFHS collaboration, where the effective strong coupling was extended from the Regge-limit domain, through the near-perturbative transition region, and into the ultraviolet Bjorken-limit domain. The resulting scheme provides a unified and precise nonperturbative description of the strong coupling across all virtuality scales."}
