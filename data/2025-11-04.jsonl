All systems have significant misaligned\nfeatures (warps or polar rings) at some point in their evolution; however,\ntheir frequencies, lifetimes, and origins vary significantly. We find that the\nmorphology of the FOGGIE disks are correlated with properties of their\nCircumgalactic Medium (CGM). We classify these systems into two broad\ncategories: those with CGMs that are Less Populated with HI and those with CGMs\nthat are More Populated with HI. Both categories kinematically settle by z=0,\nbut the Less Populated systems all form thin disks by z=0, while the More\nPopulated systems do not. This classification is independent of disk and halo\nmass, implying the formation of a thin disk is influenced by local\nenvironmental factors. Our results indicate a connection between CGM content\nand disk formation that is not yet fully understood. A second paper\ninvestigates observational aspects of these structures."}

However, its mass\ndistribution across the virial phase and the cooler, denser atomic phase,\nremains uncertain. To investigate this, we perform high-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of 0.125--8 kpc-scale representative patches of\nthe CGM, with parameters informed by quasar absorption line observations. Our\nsimulations resolve the cooling length (the minimum across all temperatures of\n$c_s t_{\\rm cool}$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $t_{\\rm cool}$ is the\ncooling time in isobaric conditions), allowing us to track the evolution of\ncold gas more accurately. We find that low-density CGM gas ($3\\times10^{-4}$\ncm$^{-3}$) cannot sustain cold gas below $10^4$ K for long, due to a large\nvalue of the ratio between the cooling to mixing time ($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm\nmix}$). In contrast, higher-density environments ($3\\times10^{-3}~{\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$) reach a turbulent multiphase steady state, with up to $50\\%$ of the\nmass in the cold phase, occupying only about $1\\%$ of the volume. To connect\nwith large-volume cosmological simulations and small ${\\rm pc}$-scale idealized\nsimulations, we explore different box sizes (0.125--8 kpc) and identify a key\nscaling relation: simulations with similar $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm mix}$ exhibit\ncomparable cold gas mass fractions and lifetimes. Importantly, we find that\nsimply sub-sampling (reducing box-size) a small region from a large-volume\nsimulation while maintaining a constant turbulent energy density injection rate\nfrom larger to smaller scales artificially shortens $t_\\mathrm{mix}$, leading\nto inaccurate predictions for cold gas survival. This means that cold gas at\nsmall $\\lesssim 10$ kpc scales arises in relatively dense, quiescent regions of\nthe CGM rather than the turbulent ones undergoing cascade from large scales."}

We present here the mass-radius sequences,\nas well as the mass and pressure distributions for various values of the\nmodified gravity parameter and the central magnetic field. The modified\nTolman-Oppenheimer- Volkoff equations are numerically solved using isotropic\nequations of state, specifically the APR, FPS, and SLy models. Comparing the\ncorresponding results in the context of general relativity suggests that more\nnegative values of the modified gravity parameter result in higher maximum\ngravitational masses. In contrast, strong central magnetic fields of up to 1018\nGauss cause only a slight decrease in maximum mass without disrupting spherical\nsymmetry. Our findings are in agreement with the observed data from GW170817,\nPSR and NICER."}

To prepare the community for this scale of data, the Extended\nLSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) sought to\nsimulate a diversity of LSST-like time-domain events. Using a small\ntransformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a\nnew state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on\nLC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications. Previous\nstate of the art was 65.5% F1 for LC-only, and for LC+metadata, 84% F1 with a\ndifferent setup and 83.5% F1 with a directly comparable setup. Our model\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art models for fine-grained early detection\nat all time cutoffs, which should help prioritize candidate transients for\nfollow-up observations. We demonstrate label-efficient training by removing\nlabels from 90% of the training data (chosen uniformly at random), and\ncompensate by leveraging regularization, bootstrap ensembling, and unsupervised\npretraining. Even with only 10% of the labeled data, we achieve 67.4% F1 on\nLC-only and 87.1% F1 on LC+metadata, validating an approach that should help\nmitigate synthetic and observational data drift, and improve classification on\ntasks with less labeled data. We find that our base model is poorly calibrated\nvia reliability diagrams, and correct it at a minimal cost to overall\nperformance, enabling selections by classification precision. Finally, our\nGPU-optimized implementation is 9x faster than other state-of-the-art ELAsTiCC\nmodels, and can run inference at ~33000 LCs/s on a consumer-grade GPU, making\nit suitable for large-scale applications, and less expensive to train."}

In this paper, we\ndevelop a framework that enables the gauging of the full de Sitter isometry\nwhile consistently incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary geodesics. We\nachieve this by introducing the concept of \\textit{covariant observer}, whose\ngeodesic is a dynamical entity that transforms under the isometry group. Upon\nquantization, the geodesic becomes a fluctuating degree of freedom, providing a\nquantum reference frame for $SO(1,d)$. Inspired by the timelike tube theorem,\nwe propose that the algebra of observables is generated by all degrees of\nfreedom within the fluctuating static patch, including the quantum fields modes\nand other observers. The gauge-invariant subalgebra of observables is an\naveraged version of the modular crossed product algebra, and we establish its\ntype II character by constructing a trace. This yields a well-defined von\nNeumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and\nproposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate that the\nalgebraic and generalized entropies are in match.\n  Our work generalizes the notion of a local algebra to that of a\n\\textit{fluctuating region}, representing an average of algebras over all\npossible static patches and configurations of other geodesics.

We find neither shallow\nshoulders nor broad dips in either the Northern quadrant I or the Southern\nquadrant IV indicating that the Milky Way seen interior to the Solar orbit is\nnot characterized by a majestic spiral-structure Grand-design; this conclusion\nis a robust one, in that it does not depend on measures of distance.

After this\nepoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching\n$\\sim\\,10\\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further\nshuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment --\ncharacterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy\n($\\alpha_5$) -- we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be\nattributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in\nboth simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo\noccupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite\ngalaxies vary with overdensity -- but only near the respective turn-on masses\nfor these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very\nnearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that\nallows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of\ndensity-dependent GAB."}

The transition radius peaks at 30--40 kpc nearly independent\nof redshift, but can reach $\\sim400$ kpc in the most massive halos, after\nz=0.5. SHs and ICL show nearly identical color distributions at all epochs,\nboth reddening toward $z=0$. At $z=2$, SHs and the ICL are $\\sim0.4$ dex more\nmetal--poor than BCGs, but the gap shrinks to $\\sim0.1$ dex by the present\ntime. Observed colors are consistent with model predictions, while observed\nmetallicities are lower, suggesting a larger contribution from disrupted\ndwarfs. SHs emerge as transition regions between BCGs and the ICL, dynamically\nand chemically coupled to both. Their properties depend on halo concentration,\nICL formation efficiency, and the progenitor mass spectrum. Upcoming\nwide--field photometric and spectroscopic surveys (e.g. LSST, WEAVE, 4MOST)\nwill provide crucial tests by mapping structure, metallicity, and kinematics in\nlarge galaxy samples."}

This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$\nsymmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates\nMajorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such\nstrings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be\nalmost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early\nradiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw\nframeworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos\n(RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the\nparameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves\ndistinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks\nand a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN\ndomination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and\neffective neutrino mass $\\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW\ndetectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range\n$M\\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\\tilde\nm\\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range.

Our results show key differences between active and\nremnant sources in both cluster environments and in lower-density group\nenvironments.

We compare our\nresults with analytic expectations, showing that the long-term evolution of\nradio remnants can be well captured for remnants whose expansion is largely\npressure-driven if the transition to a coasting phase is assumed to be gradual.\nWe find that remnants of low-powered progenitors can continue to be\nmomentum-driven for about 10 Myr after the jets switch-off.

Using the worldsheet in the\ntensionless limit, we verify that the terms appearing in our proposal coincide\nwith the partition functions of these orbifold geometries and their asymmetric\ngeneralizations. These partition functions contribute with alternating signs\ndue to BPS modes with negative conformal dimensions and charges in twisted\nsectors. The resulting alternating sum collapses via large cancellations to the\nfinite $N$ polynomials observed in symmetric orbifold CFTs, providing a bulk\nexplanation of the stringy exclusion principle. We identify different Stokes\nsectors where different infinite subsets of these geometries contribute to the\npath integral, and propose a classification as functions of the chemical\npotentials."}

A critical test of this principle involves the\nkinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole,\nconventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest\nframe. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation\nby searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of\nextragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar\ncatalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic\nexpectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\\sigma$. We present a\ncomprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating\nmajor sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation\nframework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of\nthe large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial\nselection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the\nkinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey\ngeometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic\ndipole excess of $3.63\\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and\n$3.44\\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole.
