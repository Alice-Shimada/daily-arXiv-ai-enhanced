Aims: This work\naims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body\nsimulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature,\nand grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid\nof 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters & analysed the formation & evolution of the\ntails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within\n500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological &\ndynamical signatures, & comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails.\nResults: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the\ntails & their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, &\nmass function) at various cluster masses & ages. During the first 200 Myr of\nevolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude\nthat scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the\ninitial velocity dispersion, & the near-tail is predominantly populated by\nrecent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found\nthat 15 gold & 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The\nremaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for\nfurther analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, & mass function of\nstars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent\nclusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent\nreliable samples for detailed analyses of tails.

How to produce, manipulate and\nenhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical\nsystems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study\ntwo-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and\nGeneral Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides\nan interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin\nof the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and\nalso show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases.\nThe maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known\nupper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to\nthe known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their\nrespective scattering amplitudes. Our case study may provide useful insights\ninto understanding magic in other systems."}

We explore the effects of impact parameter, electrical\nconductivity, and invariant mass on the dilepton spectra and anisotropic even\nflow coefficients. It is found that transverse momentum spectra increase with\nimpact parameter, dominated by annihilation processes, while decay\ncontributions remain sub-leading. Strikingly, the elliptic flow $v_2$ from\ndecay channels is nonzero even in nearly central collisions, exhibiting a\ncharacteristic shape--positive at low $p_T$ and negative at high $p_T$--that is\nlargely independent of impact parameter and conductivity. In contrast, $v_2$\nfrom annihilation processes is smaller in magnitude but dominates the total\nflow in magnitude due to its larger yield. Higher harmonics, such as $v_4$, are\nan order of magnitude smaller as compared to $v_2$ along with distinctive\nzero-crossing patterns. Conductivity enhances both spectra and flow but leaves\nno unambiguous signature for its extraction. Varying the invariant mass reveals\nthe strongest enhancements at low mass, with harmonic coefficients suppressed\nat higher masses. Overall, our results suggest that central and semi-central\ncollisions can carry imprints of the background magnetic field, and that\ncharacteristic correlations in even flow harmonics may provide a robust probe\nof electromagnetic effects in HICs."}

Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's\ngravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's\ngravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the\nquestion of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like\nblack holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution\nsupporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor\ncube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies\npositivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy\ncondition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon.

We use the\nGW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth\nobserving run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock\nspectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes\nfactors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and\nuniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting\nmodels show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case,\nand a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a\n~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of\nwell-localised events."}

The resulting small masses are suggested to be\nproportional to the self-energy of the $Z$ field as described by a Yukawa\npotential.

Specifically, working in empty\nde Sitter space and in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole geometries, we locate\nthe tower of pole-skipping points of such fields and show that they impose\nnontrivial constraints on the corresponding bulk two-point functions. Focusing\non the gravitational sound channel, we then extract the Lyapunov exponent and\nbutterfly velocities that characterize hypothetical dual many-body quantum\nchaos at each horizon. These chaotic data precisely match the outcome of a\ngravitational shock wave calculation, confirming that the relevant\npole-skipping points encode high-energy scattering of horizon quanta.\nInterestingly, the butterfly velocities can become superluminal or imaginary,\nwith the latter signaling a spatially modulated propagation of chaos. Assuming\nthat a holographic dual exists, we translate our results into field theory\nlanguage and propose that the dual theory can be divided into two entangled\nsectors that capture the black hole and cosmological horizon degrees of\nfreedom. Our results suggest that the black hole sector becomes increasingly\nnonlocal as the black hole shrinks and that the cosmological horizon sector\nexhibits behavior compatible with violations of Hermiticity. Finally, we\noutline simple microscopic toy models, built from long-range and non-Hermitian\ndeformations of the Double Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK)-type chains, that\nrealize these features, providing a concrete arena for future exploration."}

How to produce, manipulate and\nenhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical\nsystems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study\ntwo-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and\nGeneral Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides\nan interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin\nof the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and\nalso show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases.\nThe maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known\nupper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to\nthe known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their\nrespective scattering amplitudes.

Koshelev", "Yang Liu", "Anna Tokareva"], "title": "Energy conditions for regular black holes in EFT of gravity", "comment": "17 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good\ndescription of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature\nbelow the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower\nof higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective\nfield theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's\ngravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's\ngravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the\nquestion of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like\nblack holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution\nsupporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor\ncube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies\npositivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy\ncondition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular\nsolutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object,\ngiven that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off\nscale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the\nhorizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases."}
