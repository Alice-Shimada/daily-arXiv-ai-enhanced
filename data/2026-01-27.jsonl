We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\\star, \\rm post}$ / $M_{\\star, \\rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\\star \\rm,post}$ / $M_{\\star \\rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($σ_0\\sim2\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\gtrsim500\\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($σ_0\\sim100\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\sim60\\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $σ_0\\simeq5\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g and $ω\\simeq250\\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models."}

Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $Λ$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $Λ$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model."}

In this article we compute the clustering of CIV absorption systems at cosmic noon using quasar pairs. We analyze VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra (R = 45000) of a sample of 8 projected and 4 lensed quasar pairs that probe transverse separations, $Δr$, from sub-kpc to a few Mpc, over the redshift range 1.6 < z < 3.3. We detect and fit Voigt profiles to a total of 141 CIV systems, corresponding to 620 velocity components across all quasar lines-of-sight. We compute the two-point correlation function of CIV, $ξ(Δv, Δr)$, where $Δv$ is the velocity difference between components across all available scales. We find a strong dependence of $ξ(Δr)$ with $Δr$ at all velocities. $ξ(Δr)$ reaches a sharp peak at the smallest scales analyzed here, $Δr\\approx 0.1$ kpc, decreases steadily up to $Δr\\approx 5$ kpc and remains flat up to $Δr\\approx 500$ kpc, where it begins to decrease again. By fitting power-laws to the projected transverse correlation function $Ξ(Δr)$, we infer two coherence lengths: $r_1 = 654^{+100}_{-87}$ kpc, which we interpret as a representative size for the CIV enriched regions at $z\\approx 2$, and $r_2 = 4.70^{+1.60}_{-1.19}$ kpc for the individual CIV-bearing \"clouds\". Projecting instead in $Δr$, we find consistent amplitudes of $ξ(Δv)$ with previous work using quasars and extended background sources. Our results suggest that CIV may be a good tracer of not only the small, internal structure of the circumgalactic medium, but also of the way in which galaxies cluster at cosmic noon."}

The two paths remain physically disjoint; the detector is read out in a path-erasing basis so that no which-path information is revealed. If the detector's energy gap is path dependent during the interaction, the branch amplitudes for first-order excitation become operationally indistinguishable and therefore add coherently. With appropriate tuning -- matching the gap-to-acceleration ratios of the two branches and choosing a single relative phase -- the conditional first-order excitation amplitude cancels, while reversing the phase restores the response. We derive these conditions in two complementary formalisms and interpret the mechanism as a relativistic analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency, which we term worldline-induced transparency. We also treat finite switching times explicitly and quantify how imperfect matching produces a residual signal, yielding a tolerance window rather than an idealized infinitely sharp condition."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We develop a radial integral reformulation of finite distance gravitational lensing in optical geometry for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Starting from the Gauss-Bonnet characterization of the finite distance deflection angle, we adopt the Li-type curvature primitive identity [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.124058] [2006.13047], which reduces the curvature-area contribution to a one-dimensional integral evaluated along the physical light ray. We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $φ$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline."}

We evaluate the individual contributions of these diagrams and compute the total production cross section after imposing all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints on the model parameters, including those associated with dark matter relic abundance and direct detection limits. Our results demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the cross section originates from the exchange of the singlet fermions $N_{1,2,3}$, particularly from the dark matter component of the spectrum. In addition, we examine the dependence of the cross section on the center-of-mass energy for several benchmark scenarios in the allowed parameter space. These predictions can be probed at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders, providing a sensitive test of the scotogenic framework and the role of fermionic dark matter, as well as enabling more stringent constraints on the model parameters."}

Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe."}

Two galaxies have spectra suitable for this analysis: CANDELS 8005 at z=3.794 and CANDELS 7986 at z=4.702. For both, we measure auroral and key nebular emission-line fluxes across their full extent, allowing direct-method oxygen abundance determinations in individual spaxels. These observations demonstrate the viability of deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy for spatially resolved chemical analyses at high redshift, aided by weak nebular continua and low interstellar extinction. We derive global direct abundances of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.008 (+0.025, -0.027) for CANDELS 8005 and 7.89 (+0.027, -0.028) for CANDELS 7986. Emission-line diagnostics indicate neither galaxy hosts an active galactic nucleus. A first-order kinematic analysis suggests a potential merger in CANDELS 8005. The direct abundances agree with strong-line estimates from our data and recent high-redshift calibrations. We build emission line, radial velocity, strong-line abundance, electron temperature, and direct abundance maps for both galaxies. From these maps, we measure linear radial metallicity gradients of -0.111 (+0.026, -0.025) dex/kpc for CANDELS 8005 (statistically significant) and -0.093 +/- 0.088 dex/kpc for CANDELS 7986, where the large uncertainties limit significance.

It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1.

These dynamical differences are reflected in the statistical scaling of fluctuations: the square root of the second-order velocity structure function exhibits a slope near $1/3$ in the WNM, near $1/2$ in the CNM, and intermediate in the UNM. Our synthetic observations reproduce the polarization power spectra measured by Planck. We find that polarization from UNM dust yields spectral indices most consistent with Planck, whereas WNM and CNM dust produce steeper and shallower spectra, respectively. The WNM yields $EE/BB>2$, the UNM gives $EE/BB\\sim2$, and the CNM yields $EE/BB\\approx1$. These results indicate that UNM dust could be the dominant contributor to the polarized foreground. We present predictions at 150 GHz to improve foreground separation."}

Simulations are performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action across four different lattice spacings to enable a controlled continuum extrapolation. We compute the renormalized chiral condensates together with pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for pions, kaons, and the fictitious $η^0_{s\\bar{s}}$ pseudoscalar as functions of the magnetic field strength $eB$ up to $eB\\simeq1.2$ $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The chiral condensates exhibit clear magnetic catalysis, increasing monotonically with the field strength. In the meson sector, neutral pseudoscalar masses decrease steadily with $eB$, whereas charged pseudoscalar masses display a non-monotonic response: they rise at small fields, consistent with the lowest-Landau-level expectation, but then saturate and slightly decrease at larger fields, signaling sizable internal-structure effects. At the same time, neutral pseudoscalar decay constants are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. To quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations, we isolate the magnetic-field-induced shift in the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner corrections, and find it to remain small for the neutral pion but to become sizable for the neutral kaon. To elucidate the origin of the magnetic response, we separately analyze the sea and valence quark contributions to both neutral and charged meson masses, finding that valence effects dominate at zero temperature. These results provide new insights into the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields."}

This dovetails nicely with the existence of various random matrix models of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, within which the BPS chaos must be contained as a subsector. This paper identifies and studies a simple random matrix model that underlies all known random matrix models of JT supergravity. It is argued that it captures many essential universal features of fortuitous BPS chaos.

Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST \"Little Red Dot\" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy."}

However, the current sample of DEBS with high precision stellar parameters are dominated by short-period systems (e.g. ~90% of the Gaia DR3 eclipsing binaries have periods < 5 days). Facilities capable of performing detailed studies of long-period DEBS will be essential to further improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution.

These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.\n  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution."}

Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $ξ=ξ_{0}\\left|Q\\right|^{1/2}$, being $ξ_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=νH^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $ν$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($χ_{\\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $Λ$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion.

We demonstrate that the Majorana condition imposes that only CP-violating imaginary part contributes to the vector neutral interaction. Consequently, the difference between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in cross-section becomes directly dependent on the CP-violating phase $φ$. We apply this framework to Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS), showing that for spin-zero targets, the distinguishability of the neutrino nature is determined by the CP structure of the interaction."}

We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes. These co-evolution relations can be valuable for photometric shear surveys, where limited constraining power on IA parameters favours models with fewer free parameters."}

We perform a modified cross-correlation analysis between $ψ$ and the figure rotation pattern speed, as well as the misalignment between the disk spin axis and (a) the figure rotation axis, (b) the halo minor axis, and (c) the gas angular momentum axis. We use snapshots spanning a lookback time $t_{lb} ~4$ Gyr with 25 linearly-spaced lags from $ 0 - 2.33$ Gyr. We do not find evidence for a consistent lag between the onset of a warp and any of the aforementioned factors on the population level. However, we find significant correlations between individual time-series at various lags. These maximum correlation coefficients were significantly offset from random chance at the population level, suggesting that several of these factors do correlate with disk warping in specific situations. By examining four case studies whose maximum correlation coefficients were significantly higher than random chance, we establish clear qualitative relationships between these factors and warps.

To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines."}

If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $δ(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $δ(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $fσ_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification."}

Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and Sérsic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($Δ\\log \\mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $Δ\\log \\mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $Δ\\log \\mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation.

Motivated by the novel data, we extend to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting, a covariant quark model developed for the spacelike region that takes into account the meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. We use the formalism to calculate the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin 1/2 baryons in the large square transfer momentum $q^2$ region.

Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $Λ$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated.

The measured velocity profile exhibits a sign reversal near the filament midpoint and a maximum infall amplitude of $\\sim30$ km/s ($\\sim20$ km/s projected onto the line-of-sight) for clusters of mass $\\sim10^{14.3}M_\\odot$, substantially lower than expected for infall from an average cosmic environment.

Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\\vec p_T^{\\,\\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei."}

By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $γ_\\mathrm{crit}$, with $γ_\\mathrm{crit} \\in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\\odot$ during BBN can reach $\\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\\odot)$ within $\\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \\mathrm{s})$ ($\\sim $ 58 days).

In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use."}

Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions."}

By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter.

Our goal is to characterize the chemistry of the starless cores C2 and C16 in the B213/L1495 filament of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and to understand how it relates to the environmental conditions and the evolutionary state of the cores. We made use of two complete spectral surveys at 7 mm of these sources, carried out using the Yebes 40-m telescope. Derived molecular abundances were compared with those of other sources in different evolutionary stages and with values computed by chemical models. Including isotopologs, 22 molecules were detected in B213-C2, and 25 in B213-C16. The derived rotational temperatures have values of between $\\sim$ 5 K and $\\sim$ 9 K. A comparison of the two sources shows lower abundances in C2, except for l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$, which have similar values in both cores. Model results indicate that both cores are best fit assuming early-time chemistry, and point to C2 being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, as it presents a higher molecular hydrogen density and sulfur depletion, and a lower cosmic-ray ionization rate. Our chemical modeling successfully accounts for the abundances of most molecules, including complex organic molecules and long cyanopolynes (HC$_{5}$N, HC$_{7}$N), but fails to reproduce those of the carbon chains CCS and C$_{3}$O. Chemical differences between C2 and C16 could stem from the evolutionary stage of the cores, with C2 being closer to the pre-stellar phase.

The physically relevant model in the two-dimensional transverse space is then studied by the renormalization group method in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes.

These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($σ_0\\sim2\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\gtrsim500\\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($σ_0\\sim100\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\sim60\\,$km/s) are viable.

Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models."}

We divided their spines into 315 segments, extracted the radial profiles of each segment using $\\rm N(H_2)$ and $\\rm T_d$ maps derived from $Herschel$ Hi-GAL data, and estimated the asymmetry degree within the radial profiles ($α_{\\rm asy}$), as well as the length proportion of segments with asymmetric profiles across the entire filament ($f_{\\rm asy}$). We found that Galactic large-scale filaments reside in surroundings distinctly asymmetric and varied in $\\rm N(H_2)$, and mild asymmetric yet stable in $\\rm T_d$. Different filament morphology types do not show significant differences in $α_{\\rm asy}$ or $f_{\\rm asy}$. A bent filament shape does not necessarily correspond to an asymmetric radial profile, whereas a straight filament shape may be associated with a symmetric profile. Segments with asymmetric surroundings in $\\rm N(H_2)$ may not simultaneously appear asymmetric in $\\rm T_d$, and vice versa. We found three filaments with 4-44% of their spine show asymmetric $\\rm N(H_2)$ and $\\rm T_d$ radial profiles in inverse trends, likely caused by nearby HII region. HII regions of similar scale to large filaments can induce asymmetric radial profiles within them, indicating their influence on filament evolution. However, they are unlikely to independently trigger the formation of an entire Galactic large-scale filament, in contrast to their role in small-scale filament formation."}

We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $Δt$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $Δt$. At small $Δt$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone."}

By applying both the time-domain integration and the WKB method with Padé improvements, we show that the spectrum of massive fields differs qualitatively from the massless case. The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $μ$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $μ$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased. Taken together, these results indicate that massive fields provide distinctive signatures of regular black holes and may serve as probes of near-horizon quantum corrections in the Dymnikova geometry."}

Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $Λ$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $Λ$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model."}

Among present-day stellar systems, only globular clusters retain the ancient signatures needed to trace these primordial building blocks. Here we present the most detailed characterization to date of Tonantzintla 2, a prime candidate for a relic of the Milky Way's primordial bulge. It is a moderately metal-rich globular cluster projected onto the bulge that has remained largely unexplored despite its potential to constrain the early formation of the inner Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters using proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometry. By applying an isochrone fitting to very clean data, we obtain an age of 13.58 Gyr, a reddening E(B-V) = 1.44, a metallicity [M/H]=-0.68, and a heliocentric distance of d = 7.38 kpc. A complementary chemical-abundance analysis of seven member stars from APOGEE high-resolution spectroscopy reveals an enrichment pattern consistent with an in-situ origin. Tonantzintla 2 is among the oldest globular clusters studied in the literature, and the oldest so far analyzed in the Galactic bulge. Its age places a stringent constraint on the onset of the bulge formation, implying that star formation in the inner Galaxy began within ~0.2 Gyr of the Big Bang and that Tonantzintla 2 represents an exceptional relic of the Milky Way's earliest chemical enrichment."}

In the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, we show that TEE of time-like boundary strips exhibits linear growth as a function of temporal width in the limit of large temporal width, and that its imaginary part carries physical significance rather than being a constant. By analyzing charged, scalar-hairy black holes, we present evidence that TEE detects a hidden \"causal phase transition\" separating Type-I and Type-II interiors -- distinguished by singularity structure. We identify a critical temporal width $τ_c$ that acts as the order parameter for this transition: for strips narrower than $τ_c$, the system enters a distinct \"time-like entanglement phase\" dominated purely by time-like contributions, up to a regulator effect; conversely, for strips wider than $τ_c$, space-like entanglement re-emerges. Notably, the existence of a Cauchy horizon drives the $τ_c$ to infinity, leading to pure time-like entanglement. These results suggest that the TEE may supply a novel boundary quantum-information measure to detect structure hidden inside the black hole and suggests a deep connection between TEE and cosmic censorship."}

We analyze equatorial circular orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit, and epicyclic oscillations, showing that the magnetic field strength and coupling parameter produce competing effects on orbital stability and fundamental frequencies. These frequencies are applied to model high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.

The standard model with massive neutrinos predicts an extremely low rate for $μ$-$e$ conversion, making this process an excellent probe for testing LFV arising from new physics. Among many theoretical models that can induce LFV, the Supersymmetric model with R-parity violating interactions is one of the most studied for $μ$-$e$ conversion. In this work, we revisit trilinear R-parity violating interactions for $μ$-$e$ conversion, considering renormalization group (RG) running effects from high to low energy scales. The $μ$-$e$ conversion, $μ\\to e γ$, and $μ\\to eee$ experimental data are compared to give upper limits on the relevant 15 combinations of the trilinear $λ^{\\prime}$ couplings and 6 combinations of the $λ$ couplings, certain of which are underexplored in previous studies.

In the near future, COMET and Mu2e are expected to begin data-taking and aim to provide the most stringent constraints on $μ$-$e$ conversion.

We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths.

To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines."}

More precisely, scalar bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a unique form up to a normalization constant, whereas fermionic bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a linear superposition of scalar and fermionic branches. This is established by asymptotically expanding the Ward identities, where upon the leading terms decouple from the subleading ones. In the fermionic branch, the power-law exponent of the bulk-to-boundary correlator is greater by one than the fall-off index. Consequently, we revisit the relation between Carrollian correlators and momentum space scattering amplitudes for fermionic operators. In this context, we find that the Fourier transform bridging the two acquires an extra factor of $\\sqrtω$ for each fermionic operator.

While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.\n  We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\\rm vir}\\sim10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.\n  We investigate the galaxy-Ly$α$ cross-correlation function (\\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\\lesssim M_{\\rm vir}\\lesssim10^{13}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\\rm vir}\\gtrsim10^{13}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$.

In contrast, a large mass parameter triggers type I critical phenomena, where the resulting black holes possess a finite minimum mass. These findings suggest that semi-classical corrections from LQG have a negligible impact on the dynamics of critical collapse."}

In the charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering from a spin-1 hadron or nucleus, such as the deuteron, there are leading-twist structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. In addition, there exists a gluon transversity which does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleon. In the deuteron, these observables could probe interesting dynamical aspects beyond a simple bound system of a proton and a neutron. In addition, there are recent theoretical studies on higher-twist distributions. Tensor-polarized deuteron experiments are now under preparation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, so that the topic of polarized deuteron is expected to become one of exciting fields in hadron physics.

Given the ubiquity of filaments and their importance in feeding clusters, a proper understanding of these mechanisms is crucial to a more complete picture of galaxy evolution. To investigate them, we need large galaxy samples with resolved imaging. For this study, we analyse resolved H$α$ maps of 685 galaxies inside and outside the filaments around the Virgo cluster in addition to extensive measurements of integrated physical properties. We create a pipeline to decompose the H$α$ images into individual clumps. We find that the number and average size of clumps in a galaxy are well-defined functions of distance and angular resolution. In particular, the power-law relation between the number of clumps and the distance of a galaxy is consistent with a fractal structure of star forming regions. We formulate an algorithm to compare filament and non-filament galaxies after removing observational differences. Although we do not have any conclusive evidence for a difference in clump size distributions between filament and non-filament galaxies, we do find that filament galaxies have slightly more peripheral clumps than their non-filament counterparts."}

First, starting from the superconformal/Mellin block expansion of four-point functions of half-BPS tensor operators with arbitrary external KK modes, we employ the full $ AdS\\times S$ Mellin formalism to bootstrap the $ AdS_3 \\times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for general KK configurations. This establishes its consistency with superconformal symmetry and yields a wealth of additional CFT data naturally organized in internal Mellin space.

Third, we translate the resulting Mellin-space data into the internal spin basis. We derive the transformation kernel relating internal Mellin variables and $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry spins. As applications, we obtain explicit formulae for the scaling dimensions of long multiplets on the first two leading Regge trajectories of arbitrary internal spins, and certain three-point functions with half-BPS tensor operators.

This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions. It is shown that new physically acceptable solutions by incorporating any known three-dimensional spacetime as the isotropic basis are possible, which in turn enable one to analyze the quantum effects due to low degrees of freedom at lower dimensions."}

Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\\vec p_T^{\\,\\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei."}

The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure"}

This object decomposes into primaries via the modular $S$-kernel: $χ_{\\rm vac}\\left(-\\frac{1}τ\\right)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} dP S_{0P}(P,c)χ_P(τ)$. In this paper, we provide a bulk understanding of this spectral resolution using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with $two$ boundaries: an asymptotic torus and an excised Wilson line at the origin (\"stretched horizon\"). At infinity, we impose standard AdS$_3$ Drinfel'd-Sokolov (DS) gauge to obtain the Alekseev-Shatashvili (AS) boundary action for a coadjoint orbit. At the inner boundary, removing the Wilson line prepares the state at the cut as a sum over orbits of the $spatial$ cycle. Re-inserting a spatial holonomy Wilson line acts as a delta-function projector onto the corresponding primary, which together with boundary gravitons, reproduces the Virasoro character (e.g., of a conical defect). But we can also consider projectors onto the $conjugate$ basis $\\tilde P$, of the dual cycle. A key observation is that this leads to $S$-kernels instead of delta functions, with the BTZ character arising when the dual cycle label is in the exceptional orbit. Our two-boundary construction provides a bulk understanding of BTZ entropy: holonomy zero modes at the horizon have an effective central charge $c_{\\rm prim}=c-1$ from the kernel measure (primaries), while the universal Dedekind-$η$ in $χ_P(τ)$ contributes $c_{\\rm desc}=1$ from boundary gravitons (descendants). Together, they reproduce the full Cardy entropy. While our methods are specific to AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, they are an explicit illustration that smoothness of the (Euclidean) horizon may emerge from a $sum$ over bulk states which are manifestly unsmooth."}

Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions provide a clean benchmark via the Drell-S${\\rm\\ddot{o}ding}$ production of nonresonant pion pair, realizing an effectively zero-lifetime particle pair whose quantum correlations are fixed at production and remain robust against subsequent elastic scattering. The coherent superposition of photoproduction amplitudes from two indistinguishable nuclei encodes the linear polarization of quasi-real photons in the orbital motion of the pair, generating a nonfactorizable two-particle quantum state. This entanglement leaves a direct experimental imprint: a characteristic second-harmonic azimuthal modulation in momentum space arising from spin-dependent interference between the two sources.

These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.\n  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution."}

Static RG-improved black-hole spacetimes with an effective gravitational coupling depending on the areal radius and the Misner-Sharp mass are derived as vacuum solutions to these master field equations, and are thereby identified as solutions to generally covariant two-dimensional Horndeski theories. We discuss explicitly the embedding of previous key works on RG-improvement into the newly developed formalism to illustrate its broad range of applicability.

In contrast, integrable systems exhibit stable, symmetric probability distributions preserved by conserved quantities such as the Carter constant. We validate the method through high-precision numerical simulations in both Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries, evolving trajectories forward and backward in time. Furthermore, we refine our previously introduced particle-pair mutual information (MIPP) and perform comprehensive parameter-space scans, revealing a strong quantitative agreement between MIPP and TRSE. The two indicators emerge as complementary probes of chaos: TRSE captures symmetry breaking in orbital evolution, while MIPP measures statistical correlations. Together, they establish a unified framework for diagnosing chaos in general relativistic systems, paving a new path to understand the fundamental nature of chaos in non-integrable systems."}

In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\\le N_c\\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $ξ_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $ξ_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both Rényi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $λ$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied."}

These geodesics form a complete congruence that covers the entire spacetime. By rectifying this family of trajectories using the proper time as the time coordinate, the Novikov variables naturally emerge, providing a clear dynamical interpretation of the different regions usually identified as black-hole and white-hole sectors.\n  In Novikov coordinates, observers at fixed spatial position follow free-fall trajectories. From their perspective, the gravitational collapse of a dust star is completed in a finite proper time, independently of their initial distance from the star. In contrast, observers described by Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates perceive the boundary of the collapsing star as taking an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon.\n  We emphasize that Schwarzschild-Droste observers are static with respect to the center of mass of the star and therefore cannot be in free fall. The use of these coordinates implicitly requires the presence of a force that compensates the gravitational attraction. From this viewpoint, the apparent infinite-time collapse is not a physical effect but a coordinate artifact associated with non-inertial observers."}

Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe."}

Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions."}

The physically relevant model in the two-dimensional transverse space is then studied by the renormalization group method in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes.

If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $δ(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $δ(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $fσ_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification."}

In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $φ^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 > 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations."}

The gravitational perturbations in higher-dimensional black holes can be classified into scalar, vector, and tensor types. Considering the dimension-dependent forms of their effective potentials, the correspondence was examined for each dimension and perturbation mode. The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions. The vector and tensor perturbation types exhibited good correspondence accuracies in all cases. The breakdown of the correspondence was rigorously demonstrated to stem from multiple potential barriers, and its applicability to each mode in higher dimensions was assessed."}

Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions."}

We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $Δt$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $Δt$. At small $Δt$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone."}
