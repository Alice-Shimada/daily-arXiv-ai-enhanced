Analytical studies\nof such effects are possible within the geometrical optics approximation, where\nthe medium introduces additional light bending due to refraction. These studies\ntypically assume a cold non-magnetized plasma, for which light propagation is\nindependent of the medium's velocity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to\nthe general case of dispersive refractive media in motion and study its\ninfluence on light deflection. We consider an axially symmetric stationary\nspacetime filled with a moving medium, motivated by the interplay between\nrotational effects originating from the spacetime and those induced by the\nmedium's motion. We begin by analyzing light deflection in the equatorial plane\nof a rotating object in the presence of a radially moving and rotating medium.\nAssuming a specific form of the refractive index enables a fully analytic\ntreatment. In the particular cases of either pure radial or pure rotational\nmotion, we obtain explicit expressions for the deflection angle. Next, we\nanalyze the case of a slowly moving medium and identify two particularly\ninteresting results. First, we show that, to the first order in the medium's\nvelocity, the radial motion does not affect the light deflection. Second,\nassuming slow rotation of the gravitating object, we demonstrate that the black\nhole rotation and the medium motion can produce equivalent observational\nsignatures. We find the quantitative condition under which these effects\ncompensate each other. This relation becomes particularly clear for a Kerr\nblack hole, discussed as an example."}

PAH emission correlates strongly\nwith cold molecular gas, with PAH--CO scaling relations in the wind nearly\nidentical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The\nH$\\alpha$--PAH correlation indicates that H$\\alpha$ traces the surfaces of\nPAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by\nshocks. Meanwhile the PAH--X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects\nare controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot\ngas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the\noutflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with\nvariations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the\nproduct of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly\nover the inner portion of the outflow.

The UV freeze-in variant has a\nnumber of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can\ndescribe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model\nagnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model\nindependent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass\ndimensions.

Especially below 100 MHz,\nphase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can\ncomplicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address\nthis challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays\nfrom ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions\nencountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique:\nwe modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von\nMises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from\n$2\\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less\nheavily than cleaner data during the fitting process.

A comparison with the\nclock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing\nshows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the\nold algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even\nunder good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides\nreliable solutions across a wider range of conditions.

In this work we consider two\ndifferent axion models that can realize a period of first matter domination,\nthen kination, in this epoch. We perform fits to both primordial element\nabundances as well as CMB data and determine that up to a decade of late axion\ndomination is allowed by these probes of the early universe. We establish the\nimplications of late axion domination for the matter power spectrum on the\nscales $1/\\mathrm{Mpc}\\lesssim k \\lesssim 10^3/$Mpc. Our 'log' model predicts a\nrelatively modest bump-like feature together with a small suppression relative\nto the standard $\\Lambda$CDM predictions on either side of the enhancement. Our\n'two-field' model predicts a larger, plateau-like feature that realizes\nenhancements to the matter power spectrum of up to two orders of magnitude.\nThese features have interesting implications for structure formation at the\nforefront of current detection capabilities."}

However, a systematic\nframework for understanding the internal structure of such spectra, the\nphysical nature of different mode families, and their dynamical excitation is\nstill undeveloped. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a\npotential methodology that combines frequency-domain classification with\ntime-domain analysis, using a hairy Schwarzschild BH that admits a double-peak\nperturbative potential as a theoretical platform. Our analysis of the\nquasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum identifies two distinct families of modes: the\nphoton sphere (PS) family, arising from delocalized scattering resonances, and\nthe echo family, corresponding to highly localized quasi-bound states. We then\ndevelop a windowed energy analysis framework in the time domain, which\ndiscloses a dynamic competition for dominance between these families. In\nparticular, our results explicitly show that this competition is sensitive to\nthe properties of the initial perturbation source, and that higher-overtone\necho modes can dominate in the observed signal, which are in contrast to the\nstandard PS mode in GR. This study establishes the dynamic evolution of this\nenergy competition as a new observational signature for probing new physics and\nfurther motivate a supplemental framework for analyzing long-lived ringdown\nsignals."}

On the inner Milky Way stellar age distribution", "comment": "10 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The Milky Way's inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut\nshaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or\nhow star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying\nthese stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly\nimpacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star\nformation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia\nColour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the\ncentral regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age\ndistributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H]\n$\\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\\%$ of the total stars\nwithin 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner\nGalaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the\ntrue stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that\nthese age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic\nstar formation ($\\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago).\nInterestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the\ndetected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with\nknown merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage,\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these\ncould have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are\ncompatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for\nthe formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion\ncounterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the\nbar, as previously proposed.

However, even in scenarios\nwhere DR is 'secluded', i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM,\nit can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four\ndifferent types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling,\nand recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and\nisocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary\nneutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to\nperform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR\nproperties.
