This process often involves fitting mathematical models to galaxy images to extract properties such as size, brightness, components, and shape. GALFIT is a widely used tool for this purpose, but it requires careful preparation of input files and interpretation of results, which can be a barrier to efficient use. GALFITools is a Python library that streamlines this workflow by automating many of the tasks surrounding the use of GALFIT. These include generating image masks, estimating sky background, modeling the telescope's point spread function (PSF), and extracting physical parameters from GALFIT outputs. The software is designed for researchers and students who work with galaxy image modeling and aims to make the process more reproducible, accessible, and scalable."}

DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/202557664", "summary": "We report the Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS) as a new tool to model the growth of realistic nanosized dust grains through the progressive accretion of monomers onto a nucleated seed. NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models."}

However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework."}

Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level."}

While current approaches often rely on gravitational path integrals or statistical ensembles to recover the Page curve, our model provides an explicit, unitary quantum-mechanical evolution of the radiation. We utilize the Independent Unitary Pairing assumption, where the total Hilbert space is decomposed into N_{total} mutually independent bipartite subsystems. Each subsystem consists of a single interior qubit interacting unitarily with a single radiation qubit, ensuring strict global microscopic unitarity (Von Neumann entropy =0) throughout the process. To reconcile this with macroscopic thermodynamics, we introduce a methodology called \"Fermion-like Occupancy Bound\", which can be considered as a Holographic Binary Capacity Constraint, where each radiation channel is modeled as a two-level system representing the fundamental unit of information. This truncation, justified by the holographic principle at the Planck scale, enforces a maximum entropy bound of ln2 per channel, which naturally yields the entropy turnaround and final state purification. The central result of this framework is the derivation of a Quantum Condition for Unitarity , which couples microscopic phase evolution with macroscopic observables."}

In addition, position--velocity diagrams along the outflow axis show finger-like extensions that connect the EHV emission with the origin of the diagram, as if part of the EHV gas had been decelerated by its interaction with the low-velocity outflow. A ballistic model can reproduce these finger-like extensions assuming that the EHV gas consists of jet material that has been ejected laterally over a short period of time and has transferred part of its momentum to the surrounding shear flow.\n  $Conclusions.$ The EHV gas in the IRAS 04166 outflow seems to play a role in the acceleration of the slower gas component.

We precisely calculate entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, accounting for perturbative thermal corrections. Our results reveal that the internal energy of small black holes diverges asymptotically due to these fluctuations. The corrected Gibbs free energy attains asymptotically high values for small horizon radii. In contrast, the equilibrium Gibbs free energy approaches zero. Additionally, we assess the stability of the black hole in the presence of these thermal fluctuations. We find that, in contrast to the equilibrium state, the thermal fluctuation introduces a double phase transition to the stability of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the influence of fluctuations is notably significant, primarily for small black holes. These findings offer new insights into the thermodynamic properties of topological black holes in the presence of thermal fluctuations."}

Our models include the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; the drag force exerted by the hot phase onto the cold clouds; and the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between gas phases.

In our two-phase models, the mass and energy loading factors of both phases are consistent with recent theoretical expectations. The cold clouds are accelerated by the hot wind via ram pressure drag and via accretion of high-velocity material, resulting from the turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling.

Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$α$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$α$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\\lesssim\\!20\\,M_\\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\\sim\\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\\sim\\!4.5\\%$).

While star-forming galaxies are widely regarded as the primary drivers of this process, the extent to which active galactic nuclei (AGNs) contribute remains a subject of ongoing investigation. In this study, we integrate a physically motivated AGN spectral energy distribution (SED) model with state-of-the-art observations to reassess the contribution of AGNs to cosmic reionization. Our findings indicate that adopting a more sophisticated AGN SED model could substantially increase the predicted ionizing photon output by a factor of 3$\\sim$4, elevating AGNs to a more significant role ($\\approx$20\\%) in maintaining reionization than previously estimated. The inclusion of abundant faint AGNs further amplifies this contribution by a factor of a few. These conclusions remain robust across a wide range of accretion rates and ionizing photon escape fractions. Collectively, our results suggest that AGNs may have played a more prominent and previously underestimated role in the reionization of the Universe."}

We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution."}

However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\\propto Hρ$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a \"bottom-up\" IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\\proptoρ^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A < 7.586\\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B < 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units."}

Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs."}

In particular, effective theories arising in double holography can exhibit apparent violations of micro-causality, despite the underlying bulk dynamics being local and causal. The aim of this work is to clarify the physical origin of this phenomenon and to identify the structural features that control causal consistency in island models.\n  We argue that the apparent non-causality in double holography is neither intrinsic to island physics nor a consequence of nonlocal operator reconstruction. Rather, it reflects a mismatch between effective spacetime separation and bulk causal accessibility, a feature already implicit in earlier analyses. Nonlocal reconstruction instead encodes quantum error correction within a restricted code subspace and does not introduce independent propagation channels.\n  Motivated by this perspective, we formulate a structural criterion for micro-causality in effective island descriptions. The criterion consists of three conditions: the absence of independent propagation channels beyond those of the bulk theory, a local bulk-supported operator dictionary, and a consistent matching between effective spacelike separation and dynamically accessible bulk causal curves. When these conditions are satisfied, effective micro-causality follows directly from bulk micro-causality. We apply the criterion to brane world realizations of island models, including the defect-extremal-surface construction, and show that they preserve causal consistency, in contrast to double holography. We further demonstrate that the criterion remains robust in time-dependent processes such as island formation and evaporation."}

We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~σ$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole."}

Although for a more realistic model, one should consider a scenario where our universe has coexisting matter components like radiation-dark matter or radiation-exotic matter, etc. In this work, we have presented a systematic way to study various holographic information-theoretic quantities (entanglement entropy and complexity) of the FLRW universe in the presence of coexisting matter components. We have shown that the black brane geometry in the presence of $p$-brane gas indeed supports the existence of a universe with two-component matter sources. The second Israel junction condition, along with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, is used to compute the time-dependent holographic entanglement entropy of the universe with coexisting radiation-dark matter and radiation-exotic matter. The expression of the time-dependent volume complexity is also evaluated in these scenarios. For both universes, these information-theoretic quantities show a clear radiation dependence in the early time and matter and exotic matter dominance in the late time, which is consistent with the thermal history of the universe."}

Compared to the peak in the correlation function, it is more robust to late-time nonlinear effects at the percent level. In light of improved simulations and high quality data, we revisit the robustness of the linear point and use it as an alternative to template-based fitting approaches typically used in BAO analyses. We present the linear point measurements on galaxy samples from the first and second data releases (DR1 and DR2) of the DESI survey. We convert the linear point into a dimensionless parameter $α_{iso,LP}$, defined as the ratio of the linear point in the fiducial cosmology and the observed value, analogous to the isotropic BAO scaling parameter $α_{iso}$ used in previous BAO measurements. Using the 2nd generation of AbacusSummit mock catalogs, we find that linear point measurements are more precise when calculated in the post-reconstruction regime with 15-60% smaller uncertainties than those pre-reconstruction. We find a systematic shift in the linear point measurements compared against the isotropic BAO measurements in mocks; we attribute this to the isotropic damping parameter responsible for smearing the linear point in the nonlinear regime. We propose a sample-dependent correction that mitigates the impact of late-time nonlinear effects. While this introduces a cosmology dependence in an otherwise model-independent measurement, this is necessary given the sub-percent precision dictated by current cosmological surveys. Comparing $α_{iso,LP}$ with isotropic BAO measurements made on the DESI DR1 and DR2 galaxy samples, we find excellent agreement after applying this correction, particularly post-reconstruction. We discuss future scope regarding cosmological inference with linear point measurements."}

Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy."}

Axions are a leading candidate to be dark matter; however, a search of the full range of all likely axion masses is hampered by the standard quantum noise limit. This makes haloscope searches for axions with masses above 0.1 meV unfeasible with current technologies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new photon counting technique designed to operate at 30-60 GHz for detecting axions with masses between 0.124 meV and 0.248 meV, based on a single electron in a Penning trap. The electron cyclotron mode absorbs microwave photons, and, via the continuous Stern-Gerlach effect, this absorption imparts a measurable phase shift onto the axial motion. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze this photon detection method. We introduce a new type of fast, phase-sensitive axial detection technique, using axial-magnetron parametric amplification to overcome detector Johnson noise and cancel associated frequency shifts. This method may find other applications in precision Penning trap frequency measurements. We compare the efficiency of the electron single-photon counter with an ideal device, and find that our proposed photon counter has sufficient performance to search for high mass axions."}

White paper submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call on behalf of ET OSB Div2 - Cosmology", "summary": "Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics."}

We primarily use an isotropic model for the halo, but find no evidence favouring a particular halo model. We find DM$_{\\rm MW,halo}$=$68^{+27}_{-24}$pc/cm$^3$, which is in agreement with other results within the literature. Previous constraints on DM$_{\\rm MW,halo}$ with FRBs have used a few, low-DM FRBs.

In contrast to the gluon-dominated regime of the LHC, EIC photoproduction is characterized by an enhanced quark-initiated component, offering a complementary probe into the charmonium production mechanism governed by nonperturbative long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs). We examine the impact of representative LDME sets, demonstrating the EIC's distinct discriminating power for the mechanisms.

However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios."}

We define conformally soft loop operators, and compute their operator product expansions on the celestial sphere. The associated Ward identities exhibit characteristic non-local behaviors, which reflect the pair-wise interactions between hard operator insertions mediated by gauge bosons.

A modified power law is assumed for energy distributions, incorporating terms such as energy loss/decay, which are effective at low energies, and a source term, which is dominant at high energies. The parametrizations of the momentum distribution of primary protons and helium have been obtained including energy loss term. For muons, both the energy loss and decay terms have been included. It is shown analytically that zenith angle distributions is given by $\\cos^{n-1}θ$ in terms of energy index $n$ and the presence of decay term does not affect it.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the nature of these distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) and to confirm their blazar nature. Utilizing the technique of VLBI, we obtained high-resolution radio images of compact core and core-jet structures. To confirm the classification of these sources, we collected multi-band archival data, including total radio flux densities from single-dish and low-resolution interferometric surveys, optical astrometric positions from Gaia, and X-ray data. These diagnostics collectively help distinguish between blazars and misaligned jetted AGN. We were able to measure the core brightness temperatures and found that 11 objects show the Doppler-boosted emission expected from blazars. For five additional sources, we do not see evidence of Doppler boosting even if X-ray data suggest that the source is a blazar. These could be either borderline objects or variability may have affected the classifications, considering that VLBI and X-ray data are not simultaneous. Finally, for the two remaining objects the data suggest a non-blazar classification. Our findings confirm that a significant fraction of these high-redshift radio-loud quasars are blazars and mainly characterized by compact core structures. Overall, the VLBI classifcations are consistent with the X-ray classes. This study further increases the sample of VLBI-imaged radio quasars at z > 4 by ~10%, offering valuable on the population of AGN in the early Universe."}

We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations."}

Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $α$. Numerical root-finding locates classical turning points and numerical integration allows comparison with standard WKB results. We find that SWKB and WKB agree when the WKB validity condition holds, while the SWKB yields systematically larger (and plausibly more accurate) tunnelling probabilities for parameter values where the WKB assumptions break down. The results support the SWKB as a useful complementary approach for barrier-transmission studies in quantum cosmology."}

The energy correlator measures the energy flow as a function of the angular distance ($χ$) from the identified $J/ψ$ meson. Using the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator, the correlator is computed at both parton and hadron levels. At high $J/ψ$ transverse momentum ($p_T > 7\\ \\text{GeV}/c$), the parton-level correlator in the $\\cosχ> 0$ region is dominated by soft gluon emission during the hadronization of the color-octet state, a contribution clearly distinguishable from other partonic sources, such as underlying multi-parton interactions. The transition to the hadron level, however, introduces substantial modifications, suppressing the correlator in this region by approximately an order of magnitude and underscoring the complexity of the hadronization mapping. Further analysis reveals that the hadron-level observable exhibits notable sensitivity to model parameters: increasing the mass splitting between colored $c\\bar{c}$ pre-resonances and the $J/ψ$ meson from 0.2 to 0.8 GeV/$c^{2}$ enhances the correlator by up to $60\\%$, while extending the color reconnection range yields a milder enhancement of about $10\\%$.

The reaction between CH3 and OH radicals could also conceivably generate methanol at temperatures above approximately 20 K, at which temperature hydrogen atoms will not adhere to the ice surface. However, this process has not been verified by well-controlled experiments. Using a newly-developed Cs+ ion pickup technique, the authors investigated the reaction between CH3 and OH radicals on the surface of amorphous solid water, an ice dust analogue, at temperatures from 10 to 60 K. In the present experiments, OH radicals were generated by UV photolysis of water molecules, following which methane (CH4) gas was deposited on the ice substrate. The results show that CH3OH was formed on the ice surface through the sequential reactions CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O and CH3 + OH -> CH3OH even at 10 K. Considering the very low surface coverage of reactants in the experimental condition, the second reaction was found to occur as a result of transient diffusion of CH3 due to the heat of the first reaction."}

We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "The structure of the accretion disk in AGN is still an unsolved question, especially how it may change with Eddington ratio. Here we examine the accretion disk in the super-Eddington AGN I Zw 1 using reverberation mapping of the optical continuum. We use three years of optical monitoring with Las Cumbres Observatory at sub-day cadence in $uBgVriz_s$. The lag-wavelength spectrum, calculated using the cross correlation method and PyROA, shows a $u$-band excess. PyROA lags are equally well fitted with a thin and slim disk profile. The UV/optical AGN spectral energy distribution is consistent with a thin disk. The disk size at 4495 Å for a thin disk model is $4.23\\pm0.24\\:\\mathrm{ld}$ and for a slim disk model is $1.71\\pm0.09\\:\\mathrm{ld}$, larger by a factor of $2-4$ than the fiducial disk size of $1.07\\pm0.15\\:\\mathrm{ld}$ as determined using the Eddington ratio. We find evidence of different size scales probed with different variability timescales. Lags evaluated at longer variability timescales increase as do frequency-resolved lags at low frequencies, which we interpret as an additional secondary reprocessor at large radii consistent with the broad-line region (BLR) in I Zw 1. The high frequency lags, predicted well with just a disk, are fit with a thin disk profile and a size of $0.61\\pm0.37\\:\\mathrm{ld}$. This indicates that the actual disk size may be on the order of the fiducial size. We also collate the most extensive set of directly measured internal sizes of an AGN, from optical to mid-infrared with reverberation mapping and optical interferometry. Assuming that the disk is indeed the fiducial size, these show little evidence that the accretion disk extends into the BLR significantly, tentatively disfavouring the failed radiatively accelerated dust driven outflow BLR formation model."}

We define conformally soft loop operators, and compute their operator product expansions on the celestial sphere. The associated Ward identities exhibit characteristic non-local behaviors, which reflect the pair-wise interactions between hard operator insertions mediated by gauge bosons.

We simultaneously fit unknown FRB population parameters, which show correlations with the Galactic halo but are not completely degenerate. We primarily use an isotropic model for the halo, but find no evidence favouring a particular halo model. We find DM$_{\\rm MW,halo}$=$68^{+27}_{-24}$pc/cm$^3$, which is in agreement with other results within the literature. Previous constraints on DM$_{\\rm MW,halo}$ with FRBs have used a few, low-DM FRBs.

We utilize two state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations NewHorizon and NewCluster, post-processed with the radiative transfer code Skirt, to investigate the systematic uncertainties and biases in the inferred SFRs for z=5 galaxies; an epoch where galaxies build-up their stellar mass. We create synthetic observables for widely-used tracers: Halpha nebular line, [CII] 158 micron fine-structure line, total infrared (IR) continuum luminosity, and hybrid (IR + UV). We find that Halpha-inferred SFRs, time-averaged over 10 Myr, are sensitive to the choice of calibration and exhibit substantial scatter driven by dust attenuation, viewing angle, and dust-to-metal ratio. Adopting a steeper attenuation curve reduces this scatter significantly but does not fully eliminate systematic uncertainties. IR continuum-based SFRs trace intrinsic SFRs time-averaged over 100 Myr timescales when a well-sampled continuum emission between restframe 8 and 1000 micron is available and underestimate them with typical approaches when IR data are limited. Nevertheless, IR SFRs display a considerable scatter, largely due to UV photon leakage and strong variations in the star formation history. When UV data are available, hybrid (IR + UV) SFRs provide a more robust estimate, reducing scatter compared to IR-based SFRs while avoiding explicit attenuation corrections. Finally, we derive a [CII]-SFR relation finding a steeper relation than previous studies, however with significant scatter linked to gas density and metallicity. Overall, IR-, hybrid-, and [CII]-based tracers remain more robust than Halpha against variations in optical depth."}

White paper submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call on behalf of ET OSB Div2 - Cosmology", "summary": "Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics."}

They are rarely detected in HI in clusters, making their dynamical properties difficult to assess. The relation between field and cluster populations is unclear.\n  Aims : Detecting UDGs entering a cluster could give important clues to their evolution, both in terms of their dynamics but also as to whether they are structurally similar - i.e. if cluster UDGs are generally the same as field UDGs except with less gas and an older stellar population.\n  Methods : We use data from two deep Arecibo surveys, the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey and the Widefield Arecibo Virgo Environment Survey, to measure the gas content of the UDG-candidate VCC 1964. Optical properties are quantified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI Legacy Surveys.\n  Results : We find a significant 9 kpc offset between the HI and optical components of VCC 1964, no evidence of asymmetry in the HI, and only a modest deficiency level. This suggests a wholesale displacement of the gas content. The line width is 4-5 sigma deviant from the baryonic and over 6 sigma deviant from the optical forms of the Tully-Fisher relation. The optical component is blue and smooth.\n  Conclusions : VCC 1964 is consistent with a UDG experiencing gas displacement due to ram pressure as it enters the cluster for the first time. Intriguingly, its dynamics imply a significant dark matter deficit, however we cannot rule out that this may be due to the gas being displaced out of equilibrium."}

Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window.

Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$α$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$α$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\\lesssim\\!20\\,M_\\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic.

These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \\textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC~5098 and NGC~5096 is $v_{\\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC~5098 group interaction with NGC 5096."}

PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \\, {\\rm g}\\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^{23} \\, {\\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\\times10^{21}\\,{\\rm g}\\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^{23}\\, {\\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\\,{\\rm g}\\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^{16}\\,{\\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation."}

Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\\sim70\\,\\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $μ\\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M_{\\mathrm{UV,int}}\\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M_{\\mathrm{UV,int}} \\gtrsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R_{\\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\\sim 7$ with $M_{\\mathrm{UV}}\\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with $M_\\mathrm{BH}\\sim10^{4\\text{--}6}\\,M_\\odot$ may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase."}

We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution."}

DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/202557664", "summary": "We report the Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS) as a new tool to model the growth of realistic nanosized dust grains through the progressive accretion of monomers onto a nucleated seed. NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models."}
