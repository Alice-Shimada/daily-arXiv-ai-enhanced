Observation of this symmetry in the\nvacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies\nthat the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark\ncondensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are\nnot directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry\nrestoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with\nchirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining\nelectric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature\nT_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears\nsuggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a\nvery smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has\nbeen further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy\ndensity, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as\nN_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We\nhave analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above\nT_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.\nWhen N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the\nthree-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally\nsymmetric model in 3+1 dimensions.

These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial\nportion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the\nplasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates\nbecause of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts\ninto $k \\simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma.\nOnce the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma,\nnonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant.

A draft revised Declaration of\nPrinciples was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was\nreceived from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee.\nSince then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured\nprocess, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and\nconsultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here."}

One open\nquestion is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift,\nradio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving\nionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies\nhave investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our\nmain goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with\nmoderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in\nobservations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed\nin earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at\ncomparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the\nliterature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure\nin our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649\naligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a\njet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we\nfound that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial\nscales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas\npresent small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that\nthe kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by\noutflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and\nionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic\nconsiderations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a\nsignificant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low\nredshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot\nrule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the\ninterstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows."}

Article commissioned by Encyclopedia of Nuclear Physics", "summary": "We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge\nand of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the\nvacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies\nthat the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark\ncondensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are\nnot directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry\nrestoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with\nchirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining\nelectric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature\nT_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears\nsuggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a\nvery smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has\nbeen further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy\ndensity, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as\nN_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We\nhave analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above\nT_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.\nWhen N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the\nthree-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally\nsymmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry\nrestoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet\nquark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch. Consequently the\nstringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the\noverlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark \"mesons\" with a very small\nmean free path."}

Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the\nactivity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of\nthe host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of\noutflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately\nconstant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\\rm\ntr} \\sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven\noutflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to\nexpand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical\ncode to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a\nconstant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite\nbulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free\nparameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles,\nvariations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of\noutflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles\nessentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density\nprofile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves\nthe fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they\naccelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of\nsignificant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of\noutflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can\nexplain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The\nfree parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable\nranges.

By leveraging the\nrepresentational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most\ninformative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI\nmethods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process\ntowards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically\nimplemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network\ntraining alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well\nsuited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are\ncommonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing\nmodel fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas\nof sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable\nmanner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed\nduring inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training\nproceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations\nincompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to\nround-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly\nreduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI\nachieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while\nmaintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two\nchallenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic\ngravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing\nsystems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for\nsequential SBI."}

Two functional forms of the theory are\nconsidered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R,\nL_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \\lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are\nobtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density\nprofiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution\ninfluences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to\nverify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic\nmatter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total\ngravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical\nviability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and\nits implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational\nsignatures of such wormhole configurations.

We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\\rm ISM}\n\\gtrsim r_{\\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition\n($r_{\\rm cl} > r_{\\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across\ndiverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\\rm cl}/r_{\\rm\ncrit} \\sim 10^{-2}$.

Article commissioned by Encyclopedia of Nuclear Physics", "summary": "We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge\nand of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the\nvacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies\nthat the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark\ncondensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are\nnot directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry\nrestoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with\nchirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining\nelectric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature\nT_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears\nsuggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a\nvery smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has\nbeen further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy\ndensity, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as\nN_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We\nhave analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above\nT_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.\nWhen N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the\nthree-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally\nsymmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry\nrestoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet\nquark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch. Consequently the\nstringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the\noverlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark \"mesons\" with a very small\nmean free path."}

As the\nupcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of\nknown streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of\nindividual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality\nand quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation\nthat GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold\nfor all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with\nthe progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a\nsubset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and\ncompleteness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream\ndetection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual\nexpectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in\nthe multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters\nto account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog\ntailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and\ncompleteness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 degree."}

We show\nthat there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve\nthe SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension\nwith the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from\n$z\\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions,\nraising the optical depth to reionization to $\\tau \\approx 0.1$ works\nessentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB\ndata, with a remaining $\\Delta\\chi^2\\sim -16$ compared with $\\Lambda$CDM,\nwhereas a small spatial curvature of $\\Omega_K \\sim 0.003$ can largely relax\nthe full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\\Delta\\chi^2 \\sim -12$."}
