Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\\sim$3:1 mass-ratio\nmerger event near redshift $z\\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory.\nThis now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on\nmetal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular\nmomentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories,\nradial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking\nevent in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic\ncenter. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of\nthe disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and\nretrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high)\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the\neffect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ndistribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the\nretrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars.\nMore broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE\nmodels featuring major merger events."}

This paper investigates the differences in abundance\nevolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic\nchemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch.

This is because only the high\nfrequency Fourier modes contribute to the lensed signal. Therefore, the strong\nlensing system serves as a high-pass filter for the memory signal. Due to the\nstep function like behavior of the unlensed memory waveform, the lensed\nwaveform possesses characteristic morphology that is dependent on the type of\nthe image, and independent of the lens model and the binary system. That is,\nfor each type of the lensed image, the lensed memory waveform has an\napproxmiate reflection symmetry about a symmetrical axis in the time domain.\nMore specifically, for the type I and type III images, the lensed memory\nsignals are nearly odd under the reflection, while the type II signal is\nroughly even. In addition, at the symmetrical axis, the sign of the slope for\ntype I image is different from that for the type III image. These universal\ncharacteristic features would help determine the type of the lensed image. This\nis particularly because the memory waveform can be well approximated by a\nsuitable step function, which involves two parameters. In addition, the\ndetection of multiple images by the space-borne interferometer would also be\nhelpful. Once the type of the lensed image is determined with the approximated\nmemory waveform, one can use the appropriate waveform template for the\noscillatory component of the gravitational wave to perform the parameter\nestimation."}

In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger\nastronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition\nof new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial\neffort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We\npresent a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific\nanalysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and\nwe use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet,\noptical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic\nprocedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323\nnearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results\nwith the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human\nintervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9\nof the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the\nphotometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS\nmeasurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100\n{\\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent\ncombination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the\nremaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic\nindication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions.\nIn principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport\nSystem (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an\naccuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is\nstill required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series\nof recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the\nscientific analysis of large astronomical data sets."}

In this paper, we investigate the accuracy\nof the calculations performed by the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in\nEuclid (CLOE), a software able to handle both the modelling of observables and\ntheir fit against observational data for both the photometric and spectroscopic\nsurveys of Euclid, by comparing the output of CLOE with external codes used as\nbenchmark. We perform such a comparison on the quantities entering the\ncalculations of the observables, as well as on the final outputs of these\ncalculations. Our results highlight the high accuracy of CLOE when comparing\nits calculation against external codes for Euclid observables on an extended\nrange of operative cases. In particular, all the summary statistics of interest\nalways differ less than $0.1\\,\\sigma$ from the chosen benchmark, and CLOE\npredictions are statistically compatible with simulated data obtained from\nbenchmark codes. The same holds for the comparison of correlation function in\nconfiguration space for spectroscopic and photometric observables."}

One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts\n(FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology\nproposed by Macquart {\\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\\rm\nDM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution\nfunctions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant\n$H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current\n${\\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\\rm IGM}$ fairly close\nto its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for\nthe parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a\nsmall $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a\nloose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125\nlocalized FRBs.

Extensions beyond the standard modelling of theoretical probes and systematic effects", "comment": null, "summary": "Euclid is expected to establish new state-of-the-art constraints on\nextensions beyond the standard LCDM cosmological model by measuring the\npositions and shapes of billions of galaxies. Specifically, its goal is to shed\nlight on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires\ndeveloping and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction\nsoftware capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we\ndescribe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for\nObservables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative\ncosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary\nprobes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the\nmagnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function\nof galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's\nimplementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive\nneutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation\nof these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic\nEuclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with\nthe results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this\nwork several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could\nbe further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to\nenhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine\nlearning techniques."}

A remarkably complete and accurate sky\nmodel is therefore needed in the patches of the sky used to perform the\ncalibration. Instruments such as HERA, which use a redundant calibration\nstrategy, also require a reference sky model to fix degenerate gain solutions.\nWe have carried out a deep (20 hours) observation using the upgraded GMRT to\nmake a high-fidelity sky model of one of the HERA calibration fields GLEAM 02H\n(J0200$-$3053). Here, we present the results from a $16.7\\,\\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth\ndata centred at $147.4\\,\\rm{MHz}$.

We produce a catalogue of\n$640$ sources ($26\\%$ extended) in the flux range $0.01-19.08\\,{\\rm Jy}$. The\ncatalogue has a sub-arcsec positional accuracy, and the estimated fluxes are\nconsistent with existing catalogues.

Optical flux ratios of\nlensed quasars are typically affected by stellar microlensing, and thus studies\nof dark matter substructure often rely on emission regions that are\nsufficiently extended to avoid microlensing effects. To expand the accessible\nwavelength range for studying dark matter substructure through flux ratios and\nto reduce reliance on specific instruments, we confront the challenges posed by\nmicrolensing and propose a method to detect dark matter substructure using\noptical flux ratios of lensed quasars. We select 100 strong lensing systems\nconsisting of 90 doubles and 10 quads to represent the overall population and\nadopt the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test as our statistical method. By\nintroducing different types of dark matter substructure into these strong\nlensing systems, we demonstrate that using quads alone provides the strongest\nconstraints on dark matter and that several tens to a few hundred independent\nflux ratio measurements from quads can be used to study the properties of dark\nmatter substructure and place constraints on dark matter parameters.\nFurthermore, we suggest that the use of multi-band flux ratios can\nsubstantially reduce the required number of quads.

Focusing on\nHorndeski gravity, we derive consistency conditions directly from the field\nequations to identify the subclasses that admit Minkowski and de Sitter vacua\nwith a nontrivial scalar field. In doing so, we obtain a filtering mechanism\nthat operates independently of observational data. In this context, we\nintroduce the notion of stealth vacua, where the scalar field remains active\nwithout altering the vacuum. Following this, we examine the theoretical\nframework of Horndeski theories that admit homogeneous geometries and we\nextract the implicit form of the solution pertaining to the entire family of\ntheories. Building upon these frameworks, we construct exact solutions in\nbeyond-Horndeski gravity by applying a linear disformal transformation to the\nregularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. This procedure yields solitonic\nspacetimes with scalar hair as well as black holes carrying primary scalar\nhair, demonstrating how disformal maps can qualitatively modify solution\nproperties. We delineate the parameter space in which the transformation is\nwell-defined and analyze the solutions.

X-ray observations, primarily from Chandra\nand XMM-Newton, have revealed a wealth of information about the thermodynamics\nof this gas. However, two regimes remain difficult to study with current\ninstruments: superheated gas well above 10~keV generated by shocks from major\nmergers, and distant systems strongly impacted by cosmological dimming.\nRelativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (rSZe) produce a\nfractional spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background at\nsub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths that could offer a complimentary\nprobe of both high temperature and high redshift ICM gas. Here we describe\nmulti-band measurements of the rSZe, including observations from the Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer on the Herschel-SPIRE instrument, that constrain the ICM\nthermodynamics of the major merger MACSJ0717.5+3745.

Achieving this goal requires a continuous\nreassessment of the mission's scientific performance, particularly in terms of\nits ability to constrain cosmological parameters, as our understanding of how\nto model large-scale structure observables improves. In this study, we present\nthe first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables\nin Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this\nendeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic\nEuclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and\nnuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary\nprobes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy\nlensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of\nCLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential\nto achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$\nexceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the\nbehaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of\ninterest given different priors and scale cuts.

At fixed stellar mass,\ngalaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative\ngradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope.\nBecause EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support,\nwe adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity\ndispersion ($\\Delta v/2\\sigma$) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We\nfind a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and $\\Delta\nv/2\\sigma$: galaxies with lower $\\Delta v/2\\sigma$ (i.e., weaker gas flows)\ntend to exhibit steeper negative gradients.

The\nformation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within\nthem to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular,\nthe role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and\nprestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we\nconduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant\nmolecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the\ninterstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving\ndown to scales $\\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By\nintroducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas\nduring its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how\nmuch of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the\ngravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is\ngravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the\nwarm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular\nclouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\\gtrsim 400$\ncm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas\non the linewidth is negligible.

Averaging these\napproaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \\pm 2) \\times 10^{12}\\,\nM_{\\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{12}\\,\nM_{\\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we\nderive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \\pm\n5~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent,\ndynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly\naccounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We\nalso discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass\nestimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity\nsurface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit\nemphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the\nvelocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of\nbound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83\ntotal mass."}

In the literature, the methodology\nproposed by Macquart {\\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\\rm\nDM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution\nfunctions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant\n$H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current\n${\\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\\rm IGM}$ fairly close\nto its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for\nthe parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used.

These results\ndemonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed\nkinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new\nphysics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe."}

A promising remedy is\nthe PRISM (Precision Reaction Independent Spectrum Measurement) technique,\nwhereby the near detector measures the neutrino spectrum at different angles\nwith respect to the beam axis. These measurements are then linearly combined\ninto a prediction of the oscillated neutrino flux at the far detector. This\nprediction is data-driven, but still dependent on some theoretical knowledge\nabout the neutrino flux. In this paper, we study to what extent off-axis\nmeasurements themselves can be used to directly constrain neutrino flux models.\nIn particular, we use them to extract separately the fluxes and spectra of\ndifferent meson species in the beam.

Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\\sim$3:1 mass-ratio\nmerger event near redshift $z\\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory.\nThis now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on\nmetal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular\nmomentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories,\nradial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking\nevent in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic\ncenter. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of\nthe disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and\nretrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high)\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the\neffect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ndistribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the\nretrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars.\nMore broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE\nmodels featuring major merger events."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Star formation drives changes in the compositions of galaxies, fusing H and\nHe into heavier nuclei. This paper investigates the differences in abundance\nevolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic\nchemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy\narises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean\nGalactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar\nmetallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined\nwith increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy\nexists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We\ndemonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise\nmeasurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in\nthe Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and\nlower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently\nprecise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of\nnon-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical\nconstraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis. We forecast that only $\\sim$4 additional measurements of\n$^3$He/$^4$He within $\\sim$$3$ kpc of the Sun are required to measure the\nprimordial $^3$He/$^4$He ratio at $\\sim$30\\% precision.
