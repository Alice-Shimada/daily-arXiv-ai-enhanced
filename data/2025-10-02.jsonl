Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to\ncapture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nAstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in\nastronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice\nquestions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain\nexperts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25\ndiverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using\nAstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall\naccuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong\nclosed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six\nastrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like\ncosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively\nbetter in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These\nfindings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like\nAstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their\ntargeted development for scientific applications.

The first level\ninvolves fast coincidences among small pixel regions at a rate of approximately\n1 GHz, while the second level processes all camera pixels within an\napproximately 10-nanosecond time window. Different families of machine learning\nalgorithms optimized for FPGAs form the second-level trigger. In this work, we\nconsider two main approaches: Deep Neural Networks and Density-Based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise, both running with latencies below 1\nmicrosecond at a 1 MHz rate. This work provides a detailed description of the\ntrigger chain and its performance, as studied through simulation."}

In this work, we study the cosmological\nimplications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the\nHubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\\sigma_8$).\nImplementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the\nscenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\\sigma$ to about\n$2.5\\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results\ndemonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle\nphysics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological\ntensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and\nprecision cosmology."}

We detect soft X-ray emission out to 40 kpc from the galactic\ndisc. The gas distribution is reminiscent of a stellar outflow, with two\nbubbles extending perpendicular to the disc in a biconical shape. The spectral\nanalysis of the halo emission yields a plasma temperature of 0.56 keV, higher\nthan the typical values observed in spiral galaxies (0.2 keV). The disc has an\neven higher plasma temperature of 0.7 keV, and is dominated by non-thermal\nemission from unresolved X-ray binaries.

The discovery of a hand-full of gas clumps in\nthe realm of a few Earth masses in its immediate vicinity provides a gas\nreservoir sufficient to power Sgr A*. In particular, the gas cloud G2 is of\ninterest due to its extreme orbit, on which it passed at a pericenter distance\nof around 100 AU and notably lost kinetic energy during the fly-by due to the\ninteraction with the black hole accretion flow. 13 years prior to G2, a\nresembling gas cloud called G1, passed Sgr A* on a similar orbit. The origin of\nG2 remained a topic of discussion, with models including a central (stellar)\nsource still proposed as alternatives to pure gaseous clouds. Here, we report\nthe orbit of a third gas clump moving again along (almost) the same orbital\ntrace. Since the probability of finding three stars on close orbits is very\nsmall, this strongly argues against stellar-based source models. Instead, we\nshow that the gas streamer G1-2-3 plausibly originates from the stellar wind of\nthe massive binary star IRS16SW. This claim is substantiated by the fact that\nthe small differences between the three orbits - the orientations of the\norbital ellipses in their common plane as a function of time - are consistent\nwith the orbital motion of IRS 16SW."}

Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been\ndiscovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed\nhyperluminous infrared galaxies-- among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies\nknown in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\\sim {200 -\n6000}~\\textrm{M}_\\odot~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\\sim 30$ objects in the Planck\nAll-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES)\nare excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led\nto the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens\nmodel-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an\nextraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 -\n6.4}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically\nhave star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We\ndemonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time\ndelays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most\nfavorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring\ncampaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to\nmitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star\nformation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for\ndetecting supernovae as transient point sources.

In this\nalternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by\nheating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of\nbaryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the\nefficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most\nsignificant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the\ndwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs\nover a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and\nhalting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our\nFDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since\nthe inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs\nthrough core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ\npopulations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses\nthe mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial\ndistribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems\nencode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs.

Comments welcome", "summary": "More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use\nstrongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe\nthrough time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been\ndiscovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed\nhyperluminous infrared galaxies-- among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies\nknown in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\\sim {200 -\n6000}~\\textrm{M}_\\odot~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\\sim 30$ objects in the Planck\nAll-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES)\nare excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led\nto the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens\nmodel-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an\nextraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 -\n6.4}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically\nhave star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We\ndemonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time\ndelays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most\nfavorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring\ncampaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to\nmitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star\nformation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for\ndetecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known\nlensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement\nwide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the\npotential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension\nthrough a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques."}

In this\nalternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by\nheating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of\nbaryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the\nefficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most\nsignificant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the\ndwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs\nover a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and\nhalting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our\nFDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since\nthe inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs\nthrough core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ\npopulations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses\nthe mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial\ndistribution of GCs.

The spectroscopy in this work\nconsists of medium-depth, deep and ultradeep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 5,190\ntargets, covering the spectral range $0.6\\text{--}5.5$~\\mum and observed with\nboth the low-dispersion prism ($R=30\\text{--}300$) and all three\nmedium-resolution gratings ($R=500\\text{--}1,500$).

We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the\ndust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters\nat late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving\non the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider\nnew chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters,\nand apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a\nSupernova with a 15 Msun progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas\nconditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust\nclusters.\n  Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after\nexplosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2,\nCO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers\nof high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is\ndominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest\namounts of alumina.

We measure the angular\nauto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation\nwith multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs\nand LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from\n$b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \\sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z\n\\sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in\nprevious LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in\nbroad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence\nof bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at\nfixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes\navailable. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with\n$b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \\sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \\sim\n1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model\n($b(z)$$\\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs\nwhich reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they\nare more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b =\n2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \\sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \\sim\n1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to\ntheir properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias\nevolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer\nanalyses."}
