The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations. The experimental observation results of AT-Proto provide a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a time-domain astronomy observation array in Antarctica."}

At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$σ$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively."}

I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive."}

Analytical studies have reached different conclusions regarding loop capture in galaxies: early treatments argued for efficient capture, while later analyses incorporating the loop rocket force throughout halo formation found that capture efficiency is reduced and strongly dependent on loop size. In this work, we employ the N-body simulation code GADGET-4, introducing non-backreacting tracer particles subject to a constant recoil force to model cosmic string loops with the rocket effect. We simulate the formation of a Milky-Way-like halo from redshift $z=127$ to $z=0$, considering loop populations characterized by a range of length parameters $ξ$, inversely proportional to the rocket acceleration. We find that the number of captured loops exhibits a pronounced peak at $ξ_{\\textrm{peak}}\\simeq 12.5$, arising from the competition between rocket-driven ejection at small $ξ$ and the declining intrinsic loop abundance at large $ξ$. For fiducial string tensions, this corresponds to $\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ loops within the halo. We further find that loops with weak rocket forces closely trace the dark-matter distribution, while those subject to stronger recoil but still captured -- particularly the most abundant loops near $ξ_{\\textrm{peak}}$ -- are preferentially concentrated toward the central regions of the halo."}

Most existing studies rely on large-scale numerical simulations of the classical equations of motion, which are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. In this contribution, we briefly review the main features of the post-inflationary scenario and the current limitations in the literature, and present preliminary results from a new analytical framework for axion domain wall networks. Our approach is based on nonequilibrium quantum field theory.

Our algorithm proceeds by first enumerating graphs, or tensor networks, that represent inequivalent contractions of a product of tensors, computing instances of these scalars using randomly generated data, and then seeking linear relations between invariants using numerical linear algebra. Such relations yield syzygies, or functional dependencies relating different invariants. We apply this approach in an extended case study of the independent invariants that can be constructed from an antisymmetric $3$-form $H_{μνρ}$ in six dimensions, finding five independent invariants. This result confirms that the most general Lagrangian for such a $3$-form, which depends on $H_{μνρ}$ but not its derivatives, is an arbitrary function of five variables, and we give explicit formulas relating other invariants to the five independent scalars in this generating set."}

Abstract shortened for arXiv. Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Although many globular clusters (GCs) have been identified in the Galaxy, their population is estimated to be incomplete, especially in regions with strong crowding and interstellar extinction such as the Galactic bulge and plane.RR Lyrae stars, as bright standard candles and tracers of old stellar populations, are powerful tools for finding GCs in these regions, and large catalogs of such stars have recently become available. We aim to construct a sample of RR Lyrae stars with six-dimensional information (three-dimensional positions, proper motions, and metallicities) in the Galactic plane and bulge, and to exploit it using a hierarchical clustering algorithm to search for Galactic substructures. We build a sample of fundamental-mode RR Lyrae (RRab) stars with positions, distances, proper motions, and photometric metallicity estimates from Gaia and VVV data. Using a clustering algorithm calibrated to optimize GC recovery, we identify groups of RRab stars with similar locations in the six-dimensional parameter space. The most promising groups are selected by comparison with the properties of known GCs. We recover many RRab groups associated with known Galactic GCs and derive the first RR Lyrae-based distances for BH 140 and NGC 5986. We also detect small groups of two to three RRab stars at distances up to ~25 kpc that are not associated with any known GC, but display GC-like distributions in all six parameters. Several of these groups, mostly pairs, lie toward the Galactic bulge but show distinct proper motions or distances, suggesting they may not belong to the bulge population. Overall, our approach identifies dozens of GC-like RRab groups in the Galactic plane and bulge, which are excellent targets for follow-up observations. Future radial velocity measurements can test whether the RRab members of these groups are truly co-moving."}

Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability.

Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations."}

In the back-to-back limit, we derive an all-order expression for the energy-energy correlator, showing that it is governed by universal soft-graviton dynamics. We further introduce a particularly simple beam-averaged energy-energy correlator and compute it in different gravitational theories, including tree-level string theory. The resulting correlators exhibit analyticity and polynomial boundedness, allowing for the formulation of dispersion relations, which we explore. Finally, we discuss additional singularities of the gravitational energy correlators, absent in QCD, that originate from the long-range nature of the gravitational interactions."}

The Leo A galaxy", "comment": "Paper accepted for publication on A&A. 17 pages, 14 figures, 5 appendices", "summary": "Study the ionized gas in metal-poor environments is key to understanding the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution. However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime."}

However, by relaxing the stationarity condition on the metric, it has been shown that oscillatory solitonic solutions -- known as oscillatons -- exist. Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field. In fact, their oscillation period may lie within the observational windows of the Event Horizon Telescope for Sgr A$^{*}$ and M87$^{*}$, suggesting the possibility that this ``twinkling\" behavior could be tested via near-horizon imaging of these objects."}

UVIT, designed for simultaneous imaging in the far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1300-1800 Å) and near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2000-3000 Å) channels, has completed nine years in orbit in 2024 despite the failure of the NUV channel in 2018. As the FUV optics is subject to possible reduction in sensitivity due to microscopic amounts of contaminants, we used the FUV data acquired by UVIT over the past nine years on the open cluster NGC 188 and the white dwarf HZ 4 to study sensitivity variations in the UVIT FUV channel. Our findings indicate no significant reduction in the sensitivity of the FUV channel over the last nine years, with no significant episodic variations due to unknown causes."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We study the cosmological impact of a transient self-interaction phase in Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM), focusing on its simultaneous effects on the sound horizon and the late-time growth of structure. In the presence of a quartic self-interaction, the scalar field undergoes a short-lived radiation-like phase before evolving into matter-like behaviour, inducing a localized modification of the expansion history at early times. We develop a perturbative and model-independent framework in which the self-interaction energy density is parametrized as a localized contribution to the total energy budget. Within this approach, the responses of the sound horizon and the linear growth factor can be expressed as weighted integrals over cosmic time, with distinct kernels encoding the temporal sensitivity of each observable. This structure leads to a simple analytic relation linking the corresponding early- and late-time responses, and naturally predicts correlated shifts in $H_0$ and $S_8$ whose sign and magnitude depend on the timing of the self-interaction episode. Our results show that a single transient modification of the expansion history can interpolate between early-time effects on the sound horizon and late-time suppression of structure growth within a unified physical framework, providing an analytical understanding of their joint response."}

This work addresses two objectives: providing an up-to-date determination of $α_s$ using NNLO calculations and a sensitive nucleon data set within a self-consistent framework, and critically assessing the robustness of the $α_s(M_Z)$ extraction in light of systematic uncertainties as well as correlations of $α_s(M_Z)$ with the functional forms of PDFs and other model parameters. In regard to the uncertainty assessment, we demonstrate that some commonly used criteria, including the dynamical tolerance and Bayesian hierarchical models, may produce significantly different or even unstable estimates for the net $α_s$ uncertainty, and we introduce a concept of \\textit{data-clustering safety} that the replicable uncertainty estimates must satisfy. Based on this in-depth examination of the CT25 global hadronic data set using a combination of analysis methods, and after demonstrating a weak correlation between $α_s$ and the functional forms of CT25 PDF parametrizations, we find $α_s(M_Z)=0.1183^{+0.0023}_{-0.0020}$ at the 68\\% credibility level."}

Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $φ^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with exact $ω_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a result, physically interpreting the perturbative quantization of this theory by standard methods has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in the class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance. As an application, we compute stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time."}

Primary Thematic Area: Heliophysics", "summary": "Solar flares are the largest energy-release events in the Solar System, allowing us to study fundamental physical phenomena under extreme conditions. Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to satellites, disruption to GPS, communications and power systems, and impacts on passenger air travel. A comprehensive understanding of solar flares is therefore not just a compelling science problem, but also important for national security and infrastructure. This white paper (WP) addresses critical open science questions related to solar flares. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK has a robust and vibrant solar flare community. We are key partners in international collaborations, and also provide instrumentation for existing and upcoming ESA/NASA/JAXA space missions. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field, achieve Solar System Advisory Panel roadmap goals, and to work under the UK Space Agency's National Space Strategy Pillars. Several complementary WPs have been submitted that discuss instruments or concepts that would directly address the observational requirements we describe (including: SPARK, solar optimised IFUs, Solar-C/EUVST, and OSIRIS), as well as required numerical modelling efforts and infrastructure."}

We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $λ$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $λ$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $λ\\sim \\pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \\sim 10^{-22}\\ \\text{eV}$ and $λ\\gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations."}

In particular, the inclusion of excited bound states has been found to strongly reduce the dark matter abundance and qualitatively modify the associated freeze-out dynamics. While these effects can be captured by an effective annihilation cross section, its explicit computation is numerically expensive and therefore impractical for repeated use in Boltzmann solvers or parameter scans. In this work we present BSFfast, a lightweight numerical tool that provides precomputed, tabulated effective BSF cross sections for a wide class of phenomenologically relevant models, including highly excited bound states and, where applicable, the full network of radiative bound-to-bound transitions. We exploit rescaling relations of the cross section to efficiently cover models with additional free parameters and provide fast interpolation routines in Mathematica, python and C for use in Boltzmann solvers. As an illustration, we apply BSFfast to a superWIMP scenario with a colored mediator, demonstrating that the tool enables phenomenological studies that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

In this letter, we show that this arises from the simple fact that the correlator is obtained by integrating Feynman propagators over the full spacetime, as opposed to the half-space for the wavefunction. Several striking new properties of correlators for any graph are made obvious from this picture. Certain patterns of poles that appear in the wavefunction do not appear in the correlator. The correlator also enjoys several remarkable factorization properties in various limits. Most strikingly, the correlator admits a systematic Laurent expansion in the neighborhood of every pole, with the first subleading term vanishing for every pole. There is an especially simple understanding of the expansion around the total energy pole up to second order, given by a differential operator acting on the amplitude. Finally, we show how these results extend beyond single graphs to the full correlator in Tr $φ^3$ theory."}

Results: Compared to TRILEGAL simulations of the Galaxy's stellar content by (Dal Tio, 2022), we find a significant deficit of blue main sequence turn-off stars with $22 < r < 24$. We interpret this discrepancy as a signature of a much steeper halo number density profile at galactocentric distances $10-50$ kpc than the cannonical $\\sim1/r^3$ profile assumed in TRILEGAL simulations. Conclusions: This interpretation is consistent with earlier suggestions based on observations of more luminous, but much less numerous, evolved stellar populations, and a few pencil beam surveys of blue main sequence stars in the northern sky.

Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $Λ$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW maps for a suite of 791 $w$CDM cosmologies using the Gower Street N-body simulations, thereby enabling ISW analyses across a broader dark-energy parameter space. We make our code and ISW data publicly available. We compute the ISW signals by tracing the time evolution of the gravitational potential across large-volume simulations that span dark energy equation of state parameters from phantom to quintessence, $-1.79 \\lesssim w \\lesssim -0.34$. These data are projected onto the sphere using HEALPix to obtain full-sky temperature maps. We validate our pipeline by comparing the measured ISW angular power spectra and ISW-density cross-correlations against linear theory expectations ($2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 200$) computed with benchmarks from the pyCCL library. The agreement is excellent across the multipole range where the ISW contribution is expected to dominate, confirming the reliability of our modelling of gravitational-potential evolution. With additional tests of the ISW signal's strength in density extrema, as well as comparing all models to a reference $Λ$CDM cosmology, we found that quintessence-like models ($w > -1$) show higher ISW amplitudes than phantom models ($w < -1$), consistent with enhanced late-time decay of gravitational potentials. The consistency of our $w$CDM ISW maps and their agreement with theory predictions confirm the robustness of our methodology, establishing it as a reliable tool for theoretical and observational ISW-LSS analyses."}

We investigate $c$-quark kinetics in a longitudinally propagating perfect fluid as well as in a viscous medium undergoing (2+1)D expansion, and find that the charm production rate decreases monotonically across all medium formulations. In the $N_f=2+1+1$ scenario, charm production is systematically suppressed due to the effective mass of heavy quasiparticles.

More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles\". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars.

By setting the matrix size to one, we analyze a convergent non-perturbative partition function expressed as a two-dimensional integral, and show that it satisfies a third-order linear differential equation. In contrast, in the absence of coupling to the critical Ising model, the continuum partition function of pure BPs with loops is known to satisfy the Airy equation.

In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to \"reverberate\" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus."}

Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data.

These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 < i < 18) galaxies, with $σ_{NMAD}\\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets."}

We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\\ast > 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ it is less $0.4$\\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe.

Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS)."}

Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed.

The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\\rm log}~M_d \\sim {\\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \\sim ζ_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium."}

Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations."}

Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe."}

Degenerate conformal blocks can be described by the same integrals with special choice of parameters. Integrals satisfy various recurrent relations, which for the special choice of parameters reduce to closed equations. This setting is widely used in explaining the AGT relation, because similar integral representations exist also for Nekrasov functions. We extend this approach to the case of q-Virasoro conformal blocks on elliptic surface -- generic and degenerate. For the generic case, we check equivalence with instanton partition function of a 5d circular quiver gauge theory. For the degenerate case, we check equivalence with partition function of a defect in the same theory, also known as the Shiraishi function. We find agreement in both cases. This opens a way to re-derive the sophisticated equation for the Shiraishi function as the equation for the corresponding integral, what seems straightforward, but remains technically involved and is left for the future."}

Rather than a direct code translation, this framework refactors LASP with two complementary modules: LASP-CurveFit, a new implementation of the LASP fitting procedure that runs on a CPU, preserving legacy logic while improving data I/O and multithreaded execution efficiency; and LASP-Adam-GPU, a GPU-accelerated method that introduces grouped optimization by constructing a joint residual function over multiple observed and model spectra, enabling high-throughput parameter inference across tens of millions of spectra. Applied to 10 million LAMOST spectra, the framework reduces runtime from 84 to 48 hr on the same CPU platform and to 7 hr on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while producing results consistent with those from the original pipeline. The inferred errors agree well with the parameter variations from repeat observations of the same target (excluding radial velocities), while the official empirical errors used in LASP are more conservative. When applied to DESI DR1, our effective temperatures and surface gravities agree better with APOGEE than those from the DESI pipeline, particularly for cool giants, while the latter performs slightly better in radial velocity and metallicity. These results suggest that the framework delivers reliable accuracy, efficiency, and transferability, offering a practical approach to parameter inference in large spectroscopic surveys.

These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables."}

In this setup, the CP asymmetry arises through a rich interplay of mechanisms, including two-body decays of the lightest right-handed neutrino into leptons and Higgs or into dark-sector particles, as well as multiple 2 -> 2 scattering processes involving visible and dark states. Crucially, the CP-violating phases originate not only from conventional vertex and self-energy corrections but also from novel interference effects mediated by the dark sector, which significantly enrich the sources of asymmetry. A distinctive feature of our model is the direct connection between the dark sector and leptogenesis, providing a unified explanation for both the matter-antimatter asymmetry and DM abundance. This connection leads to enhanced CP violation in neutrino interactions and predicts new dark-sector particles accessible at the LHC."}

Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Milanković} and $0.6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Nedeljković} telescopes, and spectroscopic follow-up of the field.

Furthermore, the detection of H$α$ emission via the $6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA) confirms that the stellar system lies at a redshift consistent with the HI source, establishing their physical association. Through detailed photometry and employing color-dependent mass-to-light scaling relations, we derive a total stellar mass of $M_\\star = (7.2 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^6\\, M_{\\odot}$, about an order of magnitude higher than the previously estimated upper limit.

Our findings demonstrate that FAST J0139+4328 is not a dark galaxy but an extremely gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxy, whose stellar component was simply below the detection limit of the Pan-STARRS1 survey.

The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime."}

These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 < i < 18) galaxies, with $σ_{NMAD}\\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets."}

More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles\". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern."}

The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community."}

Due to supersymmetry, these beta functions vanish trivially. However, by decomposing the scattering integrand according to the different internal loop-exchanged states, the most general model-independent results are obtained."}

I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive."}

The flavour structure of the double seesaw framework is invoked by an $A_4$ discrete symmetry which yields predictive textures for the Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$, the mixing matrix $M_{RS}$ connecting right-handed and sterile neutrinos, and the bare Majorana mass matrix $M_S$ for the sterile neutrinos. The interesting feature of the present framework is that the combination of the double seesaw mechanism and $A_4$ flavour alignments yields a leading-order TBM structure, corrected by a single rotation in the (1-3) sector. We also derive analytic expressions for the heavy sterile eigenvalues and for the resulting light neutrino masses, thereby clarifying the role of the symmetry in shaping the neutrino mass hierarchy. We further incorporate the most recent JUNO measurements, which improve the precision of the solar mixing angle $\\sin^2θ_{12} \\simeq 0.31$, along with updated constraints on $\\sin^2θ_{13}$. We show that these results significantly restrict the allowed parameter space of the model. In particular, the observed value of $\\sin^2θ_{12}$ constrains the magnitude of the (1--3) rotation and the phases associated with the $A_4$ flavon couplings, while the value of $\\sin^2θ_{13}$ sharpens these restrictions further. Overall, the interplay between double seesaw dynamics, $A_4$ flavour symmetry, and the recent JUNO constraints yields a highly predictive framework for neutrino masses and mixings, offering a coherent explanation for the generation of light neutrino masses and testable predictions for future experiments."}

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS)."}

Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe."}

Via an auxiliary-field formulation, the GUP-generated higher derivative can be recast as a Lee-Wick (LW) partner of the spin-2. We then demonstrate that the same GUP deformation is compatible with the Galileon structure governing the helicity-0 mode in dRGT massive gravity. The GUP corrections reduce to total derivatives, preserving the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost.

Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems."}

In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures."}

In this work, we investigate how these features are modified by a TsT deformation of the background, which renders the Kalb Ramond field physical and radially dependent, thereby obscuring its interpretation as a constant magnetic field.\n  We show that chiral symmetry breaking persists in the deformed model. The meson spectrum, however, depends on the fluctuation sector. Fluctuations perpendicular to the magnetic field are sensitive to the deformation and, for generic values of the TsT parameter $\\mathrm{k}$, do not admit a consistent spectrum due to divergent behavior near the horizon, whereas fluctuations parallel to the magnetic field remain unaffected.\n  Remarkably, the combined effect of the magnetic field and the TsT deformation singles out the special value $\\mathrm{k} = -\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{H}}$. At this point, the perpendicular modes are restored. Moreover, the Kalb Ramond field becomes constant again, recovering its interpretation as a magnetic field.

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints.

We illustrate this idea using the $c=24$ holomorphic theories classified by Schellekens, which leads to a list of novel sporadic dualities. Some of these dualities necessarily involve condensation of anyons with non-abelian statistics, i.e. gauging non-invertible one-form global symmetries. Several of the examples we discover generalize from $c=24$ to an infinite series. This includes the fact that Spin$(n^{2})_{2}$ is dual to a twisted dihedral group gauge theory.

We show that this instability is resolved by the formation of a static scalar cloud supported by Schwinger pair production. The condensate backreacts on the gauge field and partially screens the electric flux, leading to a self-consistent stationary configuration.

Motivated by the increasing precision of cosmic microwave background and large-scale-structure observations, we examine whether Higgs-like inflation remains compatible with current data in this extended gravitational setting. Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures."}

For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime."}

A worldline action is an effective theory, and as such the tree-level matching needs to be corrected by loop effects, including UV counter terms, renormalization, and higher-order matching to general relativity. However, we anticipate that many features of the Wilson coefficients of the proposed tree-level action will remain unchanged even after a loop-level matching. While the worldline action is given in closed form, it contains an infinite number of quadratic-in-Riemann operators $R^2$, even for the same-helicity sector. We argue that in the same-helicity sector the $R^2$ operators have no intrinsic meaning, as they merely remove unwanted terms produced by the linear-in-Riemann operators, which are well-established in the literature. The opposite-helicity sector is somewhat more complicated, it contains both $R^2$ operators that removes unwanted terms, and $R^2$ operators that add new needed terms to the Compton amplitude. We discuss and classify all independent $R^2$ operators that can feature in the worldline action."}

In this work, we focus on a light singlet pseudoscalar mediator that connects the QCD-like dark sector to the Standard Model (SM) sector via the Higgs portal. Notably, when the lightest unstable dark meson has a mass of approximately $3$ GeV, it predominantly decays into a pair of gluons and behaves as a long-lived particle, a scenario that has received relatively little attention. We consider various Higgs production channels at the LHC and investigate two processes for generating dark mesons: (1) the cascade decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of light pseudoscalar mediators, which subsequently decay into four dark mesons; and (2) the dark shower and hadronization process whereby the Higgs boson decays into a pair of dark quarks that subsequently evolve into dark mesons. These processes give rise to novel gluon-rich dark jets composed of long-lived dark mesons. Notably, we find that appropriate trigger selection constitutes a crucial factor for detecting these signal signatures in both tracker system and CMS muon system. At the high-luminosity LHC, the exotic Higgs branching ratio to cascade decays (dark showers) can be constrained below $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-1})$ [$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-2})$] for dark meson proper lifetimes $cτ$ ranging from $1$ mm to $100$ m."}

By setting the matrix size to one, we analyze a convergent non-perturbative partition function expressed as a two-dimensional integral, and show that it satisfies a third-order linear differential equation. In contrast, in the absence of coupling to the critical Ising model, the continuum partition function of pure BPs with loops is known to satisfy the Airy equation.

This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors."}

Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found.

As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework."}

Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level.

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints.

We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT).

We consider a spherical surface that separates the interior and exterior causally unconnected subregions of the spatial slice of the global de Sitter space. The Bunch-Davies state is the most straightforward initial quantum vacuum that may be used for computing purposes. Two observers are introduced, one in an open chart of de Sitter space and the other in a global chart. The observers calculate the quantum discord generated by each detecting a mode. The relationship between an observer in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space and another in a Minkowski chart is comparable to this circumstance. We see that when the curvature of the open chart increases, the state becomes less entangled.

We establish that the large central charge of the boundary conformal field theory corresponds to classical gravity, while a small central charge corresponds to quantum gravity described by Loop Quantum Gravity. In addition, we study the thermodynamic behavior of AdS-Schwarzschild black holes for both large and small central charges. For large central charge, the classical AdS-Schwarzschild black holes have two phases: unstable small black holes and stable large black holes. Conversely, for small central charge, black holes are stable, and their entropy is smaller than that of classical black holes. To explore the influence of the boundary central charge on the information loss paradox, we use the island formula to recover the Page curve. We find that before the Page time, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time, and its slope is determined by the central charge of the boundary theory. After the Page time, the island inside black holes emerges, and the unitarity of black hole evaporation is restored, yielding a constant entropy consistent with the Page curve. This entanglement entropy, i.e. after the Page time, depends on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and includes a logarithmic correction related to the central charge."}

Analytical studies have reached different conclusions regarding loop capture in galaxies: early treatments argued for efficient capture, while later analyses incorporating the loop rocket force throughout halo formation found that capture efficiency is reduced and strongly dependent on loop size. In this work, we employ the N-body simulation code GADGET-4, introducing non-backreacting tracer particles subject to a constant recoil force to model cosmic string loops with the rocket effect. We simulate the formation of a Milky-Way-like halo from redshift $z=127$ to $z=0$, considering loop populations characterized by a range of length parameters $ξ$, inversely proportional to the rocket acceleration. We find that the number of captured loops exhibits a pronounced peak at $ξ_{\\textrm{peak}}\\simeq 12.5$, arising from the competition between rocket-driven ejection at small $ξ$ and the declining intrinsic loop abundance at large $ξ$.

We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $Λ<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics.

The near-horizon geometry contains an AdS2 throat with a constant electric field, which lowers the effective mass of the scalar and can trigger a violation of the AdS2 Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We show that this instability is resolved by the formation of a static scalar cloud supported by Schwinger pair production. The condensate backreacts on the gauge field and partially screens the electric flux, leading to a self-consistent stationary configuration. The scalar profile is obtained analytically from the near-horizon equations and exhibits the characteristic behavior of a BF-violating mode in AdS2. We analyze the associated boundary conditions, the induced charge density, and the resulting modification of the electric field. The resulting configuration can be interpreted as an electric analogue of known magnetic hairy black hole solutions. Our results provide a concrete realization of electric screening in extremal charged black holes and clarify the role of near-horizon dynamics in shaping the infrared structure of the solution."}

In the presence of a quartic self-interaction, the scalar field undergoes a short-lived radiation-like phase before evolving into matter-like behaviour, inducing a localized modification of the expansion history at early times. We develop a perturbative and model-independent framework in which the self-interaction energy density is parametrized as a localized contribution to the total energy budget. Within this approach, the responses of the sound horizon and the linear growth factor can be expressed as weighted integrals over cosmic time, with distinct kernels encoding the temporal sensitivity of each observable. This structure leads to a simple analytic relation linking the corresponding early- and late-time responses, and naturally predicts correlated shifts in $H_0$ and $S_8$ whose sign and magnitude depend on the timing of the self-interaction episode. Our results show that a single transient modification of the expansion history can interpolate between early-time effects on the sound horizon and late-time suppression of structure growth within a unified physical framework, providing an analytical understanding of their joint response."}

A worldline action is an effective theory, and as such the tree-level matching needs to be corrected by loop effects, including UV counter terms, renormalization, and higher-order matching to general relativity. However, we anticipate that many features of the Wilson coefficients of the proposed tree-level action will remain unchanged even after a loop-level matching. While the worldline action is given in closed form, it contains an infinite number of quadratic-in-Riemann operators $R^2$, even for the same-helicity sector. We argue that in the same-helicity sector the $R^2$ operators have no intrinsic meaning, as they merely remove unwanted terms produced by the linear-in-Riemann operators, which are well-established in the literature. The opposite-helicity sector is somewhat more complicated, it contains both $R^2$ operators that removes unwanted terms, and $R^2$ operators that add new needed terms to the Compton amplitude. We discuss and classify all independent $R^2$ operators that can feature in the worldline action."}

We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $λ$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $λ$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $λ\\sim \\pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \\sim 10^{-22}\\ \\text{eV}$ and $λ\\gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations."}

Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions). We explore the features of these unions, and show that they are pseudo-positive geometries, in contrast to positive geometry of a single oriented region. For all non-planar diagrams which are \\emph{internally planar} there always exists a strongly connected geometry, and for those that are \\emph{irreducible}, there exists a geometry with no spurious facets. We also prove that the already known identity moves, square and sphere moves, form the complete set of identity moves for all MHV on-shell diagrams."}

The Bunch-Davies state is the most straightforward initial quantum vacuum that may be used for computing purposes. Two observers are introduced, one in an open chart of de Sitter space and the other in a global chart. The observers calculate the quantum discord generated by each detecting a mode. The relationship between an observer in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space and another in a Minkowski chart is comparable to this circumstance.

We consider a spherical surface that separates the interior and exterior causally unconnected subregions of the spatial slice of the global de Sitter space. The Bunch-Davies state is the most straightforward initial quantum vacuum that may be used for computing purposes. Two observers are introduced, one in an open chart of de Sitter space and the other in a global chart. The observers calculate the quantum discord generated by each detecting a mode. The relationship between an observer in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space and another in a Minkowski chart is comparable to this circumstance. We see that when the curvature of the open chart increases, the state becomes less entangled. Nevertheless, we see that even in the limit when entanglement vanishes, the quantum discord never goes away."}

We construct flavor operators associated with mass identification, flavor change, and charged-current weak mixing which arise from fundamental interactions in the Standard Model. We treat these interactions as alternative measurement settings in a Gendanken experiment. For entangled two-particle states, these operators generate nontrivial correlations that violate Bell-type bounds, excluding non-contextual local descriptions under the stated assumptions. These violations arise from the algebraic structure of the operators rather than from kinematic correlations or exotic dynamics. We discuss how the predicted correlation patterns may be probed with experimental data, clarifying the scope and limitations of Bell-type reasoning in particle physics."}

Via an auxiliary-field formulation, the GUP-generated higher derivative can be recast as a Lee-Wick (LW) partner of the spin-2.

For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, in cases V and VI, the Hamiltonian analysis yields 8 degrees of freedom, while only 6 and 5 modes are visible at linear order in perturbations, respectively. This indicates that additional modes are strongly coupled on cosmological backgrounds."}

These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero.

As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework."}
