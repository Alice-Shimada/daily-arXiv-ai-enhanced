In an extended parameter space including primordial non-Gaussianity, summed neutrino mass, and $Λ$CDM parameters, Fisher analysis demonstrates that power spectra of transformed fields provide strong complementary constraints. A central result is that these power spectra can directly capture the local primordial non-Gaussianity imprinted in large-scale structure. This opens a new avenue for probing the physics of the early Universe with Stage-IV surveys using two-point statistics."}

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field.

Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_π(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations."}

Extending the Copeland-Liddle-Wands (CLW) scalar-fluid dynamical system to a six-dimensional phase space including shear, curvature, and spin-torsion, I recast the equations in a compact deceleration-parameter form, compute the full Jacobian, and evaluate maximal Lyapunov exponents. Numerical solutions show that the ekpyrotic branch ($w_φ\\gg1$) exponentially damps homogeneous shear, while the softened branch ($w_φ<1$) allows $ρ_s$ to overtake the scalar during contraction and trigger a torsion-supported bounce at high but finite densities where the EC spin-torsion term becomes dynamically dominant. Scans in a two-parameter softening plane $(φ_{\\rm b},Δ)$ identify a finite region of nonsingular trajectories and quantify the required tuning; in the parameter ranges explored the maximal Lyapunov exponent on the constrained phase space is negative, giving no indication of chaotic behavior in this homogeneous truncation even when the usual curvature mode that destabilizes contracting General Relativity (GR) backgrounds is included. The construction is purely phenomenological and confined to homogeneous backgrounds: it does not address entropy accumulation, the cosmological arrow of time, or a complete cyclic cosmology."}

For a broad class of theories, we demonstrate that the existence of finitely many charged particles logically necessitates the existence of infinitely many charged particles populating the entire charge lattice.

Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $α$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries."}

The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($χ$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables."}

Challenges exist in encoding the minimal and physical degrees of freedom for a non-Abelian gauge theory and maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics in a simulation. In this work, the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation of the 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory is used to define an efficient mapping of SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto qubits. It is shown that the required number of qubits in the LSH basis is significantly reduced compared to its IRREP basis counterpart. While the non-Abelian Gauss laws of the SU(3) theory are automatically satisfied by the usage of LSH variables, the remnant constraints on the consistency of the flux numbers still exist. During time evolution, the noise can accumulate and take the state out of the sector of the Hilbert space where the constraint is satisfied. With this motivation, an oracle algorithm is constructed to be applied to the qubits for checking the local constraint at a given link. Costs in terms of qubit and gate number, and circuit depth, are found."}

There has recently been considerable progress in the interpretation and precision calculation of these correlations, using a specific class of observables called energy correlators (EECs). These observables are most cleanly studied in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where they can be measured over their full angular range. Of particular interest are kinematic limits of the correlator, both collinear, and back-to-back, where the correlator exhibits scaling behaviors governed by specific operators in QCD. Resolving these scalings requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, which can be achieved by performing measurements on tracks (charged particles). In this paper we perform the first calculation of the track-based EEC over its entire kinematic range, achieving a record precision of of NNLL (collinear) + NNLO (fixed order) + NNNNLL (back-to-back) for the track-based EEC, and additionally incorporate the leading non-perturbative corrections and their resummation, including the Collins-Soper kernel computed using lattice QCD. We describe the breadth of physics probed by this observable, and highlight the impact of different components of our factorization theorem on the final distribution. Combined with recent measurements of the track-based EEC with archival LEP data, our calculation initiates the precision study of track-based observables at LEP, which will lead to new insights into the dynamics of QCD, and the precision extraction of its underlying parameters."}

In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection."}

Working in the high-energy limit, we identify two novel mass-dependent effects arising from the heavy quark coupling to the local medium flow. The first is the emergence of a tensorial jet transport coefficient, $\\hat{q}_{ij}$, which encodes the directional structure of transverse-momentum broadening. The second, named the directional dead-cone effect, corresponds to an anisotropic suppression of medium-induced radiation aligned with the hydrodynamic flow. We discuss how these effects manifest in jet observables and identify distinctive signature of heavy quark dynamics in an evolving medium."}

Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^μ$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^μ$ in such a general covariant form that $s^μ=au^μ+ bj^μ$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^μ=(s-bj^0)u^μ/u^0+ bj^μ$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly."}

They can be interpreted as quantum field theoretic states of closed universes encoding quantum gravitational effects of the past. We propose a method of modelling gravitationally prepared states in two dimensions with random matrix product states (RMPS). Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions. In particular, using RMPS models, we find that off-shell wormholes lead to nonzero long-distance correlators in gravitationally prepared states. We also define RMPS models in continuous space, and discuss implications for studying de Sitter gravitationally prepared states."}

These observations reveal previously unexplored properties of dual and lensed systems, key to understanding galaxy evolution, black hole mergers, and strong-lensing modeling. Targets were selected using the Gaia Multi-Peak (GMP) technique, which identifies pairs of point-like sources with separations below 0.8\" in the Gaia catalog. MUSE spatially resolved spectroscopy provides redshifts, ionization diagnostics, and absorption systems along the line of sight. We report results for 30 GMP-selected targets at z=0.5-3.5. All systems show at least two spatially resolved components. Nineteen objects are confirmed as AGN multiplets, including 6 dual AGN, 10 doubly-lensed quasars, and 3 quadruply-lensed systems, while the remaining 11 correspond to alignments with foreground stars. Among spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN in the literature, 24 pairs have separations below 7 kpc, and our sample accounts for 25% of them. We study dual and lensed AGN distributions as a function of redshift, magnitude, and projected separation, and find that bright systems (J<16.5) are dominated by lensed quasars, whereas the fraction of dual AGN increases at fainter magnitudes. This first-year sample demonstrates the high efficiency of GMP pre-selection combined with MUSE spectroscopy. The full program, targeting 150 systems, will enable statistical studies of dual AGN incidence and detailed constraints on mass distribution in strong-lensing galaxies."}

Since increasing the amplitude of the inhomogeneities will make inflation less robust and hence require a higher characteristic scale in order for inflation to succeed, for a given number of e-folds achieved by the homogeneous solution $r_{crit}$ is a lower bound."}

We work in the opacity expansion of the SCET$_{\\rm G}$ formalism, where the propagating quarks and gluons interact with the medium via Glauber gluon exchanges. We compute the corresponding one-loop jet functions using the medium-induced splitting kernels at first order in opacity and perform resummation at leading logarithmic (LL) order.

Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically, using the method of regions, the Coulomb-logarithmic enhancement regulated by plasma screening for EEC. We compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data in $p$-Pb collisions and make projections for O-O collisions to test whether energy correlators could serve as sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dynamics in small collision systems, offering a robust and model-independent avenue for constraining jet evolution in QCD matter."}

While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures."}

For a theory with symmetry $G_1\\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $η$-invariant associated with the $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries."}

We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map.

Serial charge-transfer efficiency (x-CTE) refers to the horizontal transer of charge. Serial CTE losses were first assessed in WFC3/UVIS in 2014 (WFC3/ISR 2014-02), where it was found that bright stars were shifted by roughly 0.0015 pixel away from the readout amplifier. Now that the WFC3/UVIS CCD has spent more than three times as long in space, imperfect serial CTE should have three times the impact on the images, so we revisit the effect and characterize serial CTE in a similar manner to our models for parallel-CTE by using a combination of warm pixels, cosmic rays, saturated stars, and overscan pixels. Overall, serial CTE has a much smaller impact on images than does parallel CTE. As of 2023, parallel CTE can have a roughly 5 percent impact on bright sources and a greater than 50 percent impact on faint sources, and serial CTE can have a roughly 1% impact on bright sources and a roughly 3 percent impact on fainter sources. The first few pixels in the serial CTE trails are much sharper than the parallel trails, but there is a very faint component to the serial trails that extends much farther than the parallel trails, even wrapping around to the next row. We develop a pixel-based model for the trapping and release of charge in the serial register and release a stand-alone beta-version of this pixel-based serial-CTE correction. Most images are not significantly impacted by the x-CTE effect, however HST users that require high-precision astrometry could benefit from this correction. At the very least, curious users can quantify its potential impact on their science."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshift and small scales. The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k <= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II."}

With gluinos in split-supersymmetry as a working example, we show that these trapped particles can be recovered from detector materials once prepared in liquid form, for example, by melting silicon detectors, extracting liquid argon from the electromagnetic calorimeter, or constructing a large water pool near ATLAS or CMS. These liquid samples can then be processed using iterative centrifugation followed by mass spectrometry, enabling single-particle sensitivity in macroscopic samples. This method can potentially discover gluinos up to 3 TeV in mass at the HL-LHC. It can also improve upon existing limits for other long-lived particles. For example, it can discover the stop up to 2 TeV, and will also be sensitive to integer-charged particles in the TeV range."}

The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $η\\sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \\lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels."}

In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity."}

As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions.

We then apply it to 14 star-forming galaxies at $1.0<z<2.5$ using JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the NGDEEP survey. First, we construct spatially resolved ($\\sim$1~kpc per pixel) Balmer decrement ($Hα/Hβ$) maps of these galaxies and derive their corresponding dust attenuation and intrinsic SFR maps. We then rank-order the map pixels by attenuation and construct a cumulative distribution curve of the total SFR as a function of increasing attenuation. We define $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$, and $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{90\\%}$ as the dust attenuation levels behind which 10\\%, 50\\%, and 90\\% of the total integrated SFR is screened, respectively. These metrics quantify the probability that a given star-forming region lies behind a given level of attenuation. Across the full sample, 50\\% of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher ($\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$). This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. The value of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$ equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. The globally measured attenuation more closely matches $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$ than $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$. This suggests that the global value is weighted toward the least dust-obscured star-forming regions and significantly underestimates the typical attenuation a star-forming region encounters.

We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.

The Standard Model is extended by a local $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}\\otimes\\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ symmetries, together with gauge-singlet scalars and neutral leptons. Owing to the preserved discrete symmetries after spontaneous symmetry breaking, the linear and inverse seesaw mechanisms are dynamically generated at the two-loop level, while the same symmetries ensure the stability of both scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. One of the distinctive features of the model is a fermionic dark matter candidate whose mass is generated at one loop, whereas scalar dark matter masses arise at tree level. The model satisfies current constraints from neutrino oscillation data, dark matter direct detection, invisible Higgs decays, $Z'$ searches, and charged lepton flavor violation, in addition we also discuss predictions for muonium states. The outcome of our analysis is that the inverse seesaw contribution dominates over the linear one, suggesting that atmospheric neutrino mass squared splitting arises from the inverse seesaw mechanism, whereas the solar one is generated from the linear seesaw. Finally, our model offers an explanation of the hierarchy between the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass squared splittings, in addition to the smallness of active neutrino masses, feature not presented in many low-scale seesaw models. In addition, our parameter-space scan shows a slight preference for the normal neutrino mass ordering."}

Many AGN show a narrow Fe K-alpha line at 6.4 keV and associated Compton-scattered continua, produced by primary continuum scattering in cold, neutral material far from the central supermassive black hole. We present a novel approach based on Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to train a machine-learning (ML) model using NuSTAR spectral fitting results from the literature, adopting the physically motivated MYTORUS-decoupled model, which separates line-of-sight and global equivalent hydrogen column densities (NH_Z and NH_S). To overcome limitations of traditional frequentist fitting such as local minima, limited automation, reproducibility, and computational cost, we employ normalizing flows and autoregressive networks to learn flexible posterior distributions from simulated spectra. From 34 NuSTAR spectral fits, we generate 34,000 synthetic spectra using uniform and Gaussian parameter distributions, showing that the latter is more strongly observationally driven. The network is trained to infer four MYTORUS parameters: NH_Z, NH_S, the photon index Gamma, and the relative normalization AS. Mutual information analysis identifies optimal spectral regions and motivates the inclusion of redshift, exposure time, and Galactic absorption. The observation-based grid significantly outperforms uniform sampling, achieving predictive accuracies above 90 percent for NH_S and AS, 89 percent for NH_Z, and 82 percent for Gamma within one sigma, with a joint accuracy of 70 percent for all parameters. We publicly release ML MYTORUS with a web interface enabling fast, reproducible inference from NuSTAR spectra. An application to NGC 4388 illustrates the promise of this approach."}

The experiment leverages the axion's derivative coupling to electrons, which induces an effective A.C. magnetic field on a sample of electron spins polarized by a D.C. magnetic field and a micromagnet. A second pump field at a nearby frequency enhances the signal, with the detuning matched to the resonant frequency of a magnet-loaded mechanical oscillator. The resulting spin-dependent force is detected with hih sensitivity via optical interferometry. Accounting for the relevant noise sources, we show that current technology can be used to put constraints competitive with those from laboratory experiments with just a minute of integration time. Furthermore, varying the pump field frequency and D.C. magnetic field allows one to scan the axion mass. Finally, we explore this setup's capability to put constraints on other dark matter - Standard Model couplings."}

This study demonstrates that CH2NH, a simple nitrogen- and carbon-bearing molecule previously detected with pointed observations in other cold cores, is present and spatially extended in the evolved pre-stellar core L1544.

Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives."}

Further developments started from HBT experiments to exploit quantum bunching of photons in incoherent light sources played foundational role in the development of quantum optics.\n  When the two detectors in an HBT experiment are co-located, typically implemented using a beam splitter, a zero-baseline intensity correlation is obtained, which after deconvolution of the detector response function, yields the temporal component of the second-order coherence function. Unlike spatial correlations, this function is independent of the source brightness distribution, or its size, giving direct insight into the properties of the source's emission process itself - photon statistics. Along with photometric and spectral information, the second order coherence function can be used to constrain the emission mechanisms and discriminate between thermal, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and stimulated emission processes. Evolution of the emission processes would likewise drive changes in the second order coherence. Light coherence information along with multi-wavelength observations, can become a complementary \"messenger\", carrying internal information about the astronomical source."}

The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $η\\sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \\lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units.

In particular, experimental data for the neutral pion Form Factor exhibits a deviation from the expected asymptotic behavior, and the charged pion form factor remains comparatively less explored. To address these issues, we employ the pion distribution amplitude formalism to investigate the Form Factor behavior in this intermediate regime. Our results suggests that non-perturbative physics of the strong interaction is relevant even at energy scales traditionally considered perturbative, implying that the perturbative regime could occur at higher energies than previously thought.

Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious\" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory."}

Our algorithm exhibits comparable performance to the standard matched-filter pipeline and to the machine-learning algorithms that participated in the mock data challenge, MLGWSC-1. The demonstration also shows that our algorithm achieves reasonable sensitivity with practical computational resources."}

Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration."}

For extremal configurations, the near-horizon limit yields a warped $\\mathrm{AdS}_3$ geometry with an associated Maxwell field aligned to the $U(1)$ fibration. Imposing standard Kerr/CFT boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebra gives rise to a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_L$ and left-moving temperature $T_L$ that depend explicitly on the external field strength. The Cardy formula then reproduces exactly the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr--BR black hole for any admissible value of the Bertotti--Robinson field, thereby establishing a consistent Kerr/CFT dual description.

By systematically varying the neutral-ion coupling strength and decomposing the turbulent velocity field into Alfvén, slow, and fast modes, we quantify how each mode responds to the transition from strong to weak coupling. In the strong-coupling regime, the Alfvén and slow modes follow nearly Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectra and dominate the kinetic energy budget, while fast modes exhibit a steeper spectrum and contribute $\\sim$10\\% of the total energy. As the coupling weakens and neutral-ion damping becomes significant, all mode spectra steepen, with the Alfvén mode approaching a dissipation-dominated $k^{-4}$ spectrum. The slow-mode energy fraction increases substantially toward small scales, reaching up to $\\sim$70\\% near the damping scale, whereas the Alfvén-mode fraction decreases correspondingly. In contrast, the fast-mode energy fraction remains largely insensitive to coupling strength. These results demonstrate that partial ionization not only steepens the turbulent spectra but also reshapes the mode energy distribution, enhancing the relative importance of the slow mode while suppressing Alfvén mode in the damping regime. Our findings have important implications for turbulence-driven processes in the partially ionized interstellar medium, including cosmic-ray transport and acceleration."}

In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$ν$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$ν$ from alternative proposals."}

The joining hypersurface requires that the shift vector of the warp drive spacetime must satisfy the solution of a particular inviscid Burgers equation, namely, the gauge where the shift vector is not a function of the $y$ and $z$ spacetime coordinates. Such a gauge connects the warp drive metric to shock waves via a Burgers-type equation, which was previously found to be an Einstein equations vacuum solution for the warp drive geometry. It is also shown that not all Ricci and Riemann tensors components are zero at the joining hypersurface, but for that to happen they depend on the shift vector solution of the inviscid Burgers equation at the joining wall. This means that the warp drive geometry is not globally flat."}

We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble.

Various methods of analysis are used, namely, the methods of calculating the maximum characteristic Lyapunov exponents (MCLE), MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits), the Poincaré section method, the frequency method based on calculating fundamental frequencies, and a new method is proposed based on calculating the orbit amplitude spectrum as a function of time and calculating the entropy of the amplitude spectrum as a measure of orbital chaos. Bimodality is found in the histogram of the distribution of positive Lyapunov exponents calculated in the classical version, without renormalizing the shadow orbit, which allows implementing a probabilistic method for GC classification, which is also a new approach. To construct the orbits of globular clusters, we used the gravitational potential model with a bar in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid. The following bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the semi-major axis 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis 25$^o$, rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, we used the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3), as well as new refined average distances to globular clusters.

We describe the set of light curves obtained by EROS-2 program over the years 1996 to 2003, monitoring more than 86 million stars, which is publicly released through the Centre de Données de Strasbourg (CDS). The numbers of light curves in this data set are 28.7 and 4.0 million in LMC, respectively SMC, 42.9 million in the Galactic Bulge and 10.4 million towards the Galactic spiral arms, with several hundred measurements for each object.

In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear.

With CAPOS, we can mitigate the observational difficulties limiting access to bulge globular clusters in the optical and investigate them in more detail in the near-IR. Aims. To perform a rigorous abundance analysis of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6304, in order to determine its detailed chemical composition and identify multiple populations. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-IR spectra of 27 giant members. The abundances of 17 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ce) were derived using the BACCHUS code, using atmospheric parameters from both ASPCAP and photometry (Gaia and 2MASS). Results. We derived $[{\\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\\pm0.05$ using the ASPCAP parameters, and $[{\\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\\pm0.08$ when using photometric parameters, with no evidence of an intrinsic metallicity spread. NGC 6304 shows $[α/{\\rm Fe}]_{\\rm spec} = 0.24\\pm0.07$ and $[α/{\\rm Fe}]_{\\rm phot} = 0.23\\pm0.08$. We find a significant spread in $[{\\rm N/Fe}]$, with $σ_{\\rm spec} = 0.54$ and $σ_{\\rm phot} = 0.46$, along with a C-N anticorrelation. Furthermore, we detect a correlation of Ce with both N and Al, consistent with patterns observed in some metal-rich bulge globular clusters. Conclusions. We find a significant star-to-star variation in Na, but a minimal variation in O. The absence of the Mg-Al anticorrelation supports the evidence that the MgAl cycle is not active in globular clusters at high metallicity. The observed correlation between Ce and both N and Al suggests that the enrichment of these elements may be driven by asymptotic giant branch stars, positioning Ce as an element involved in multiple populations in metal-rich globular clusters. We find that abundances are consistent with those of bulge field stars of similar metallicity, suggesting a similar origin and chemical evolution."}

We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $τ_λ \\propto λ^β$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays."}

The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius.

We begin by summarizing the purity constraints implied by the current strong limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment in 2024, presenting them as lower bounds on gaugino masses in scenarios with decoupled sfermions and heavy Higgs bosons. We further quantify how these constraints will evolve as direct detection approaches various neutrino fog discovery and exclusion definitions and future exclusion projections. Finally, given that nearly pure higgsinos remain notoriously challenging to probe directly at colliders, we explore complementary signatures in which higgsinos are produced from the decays of heavier superpartners, where additional leptons and jets can be used for triggering. In particular, we advocate for searches of stop and wino pairs decaying directly to higgsinos as a promising means to probe higgsino dark matter well into the neutrino fog era."}

The addition of custom adjoints facilitates efficient end-to-end gradients and multi-device scaling. We present simulations up to 1024^3 elements, run on distributed GPU systems, and we show gradient-based reconstructions of complex initial conditions in turbulent, self-gravitating, radiatively cooling flows. The code is written in JAX, and the solver's modular finite-volume components are compiled by XLA into fused accelerator kernels, delivering high-throughput forward runs and tractable differentiation through long integrations."}

The object of study is evidence for jet suppression in small and large collision systems. Conventional methods include Pb-Pb centrality determination via classical Glauber model and evidence for high-$ p_t$ suppression sought via spectrum ratio $R_\\text{AA}$. Previous $p$-Pb studies questioned the validity of the classical Glauber model. In the present study A-A geometry is determined instead via ensemble-mean $\\bar p_t$ data. Based on certain features of Pb-Pb spectra the validity of the factorization assumption is also questioned. The entire jet contribution is therefore treated without factorization in ratio to a $p$-$p$ spectrum model as reference. These new results indicate that exclusivity (a nucleon may only interact with one nucleon ``at a time'') and time dilation (experienced by participant partons) play an essential role in jet production not incorporated in Glauber model or hard-component factorization. The combination determines an effective number of N-N collisions per participant nucleon given specific Pb-Pb centrality: multiple collisions if associated with low-$x$ (slow) partons, a single collision if associated with high-$x$ (fast) partons experiencing strong time dilation. The effect on parton fragment (jet) distributions on $p_t$ may be misinterpreted as jet suppression, but is similar to projectile-proton fragment distributions on pseudorapidity from fixed-target $p$-A experiments where low-$η$ densities scale with A while high-$η$ densities are consistent with $p$-$p$ collisions. $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb spectra similarly analyzed reflect the same physics given different geometries. Actual jet suppression related to QGP formation is not evident."}

Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry."}

While already established in amplitude interferometry, for the recently expanding field of intensity interferometers the closure phase enables recovering information of the interferometric phases that are otherwise inaccessible with this technique. To extract the (cosine of) the closure phase ($\\cos φ$) in intensity interferometry, third-order correlations between three simultaneously measuring telescopes have to be computed. As the signal-to-noise of such three-photon correlations is too small for current generation intensity interferometers, no third-order correlations of astrophysical targets have been recorded so far. In this paper we present the first measurements of third order correlation functions of two stellar systems, Nunki ($σ$ Sgr) and Dschubba ($δ$ Sco), observed with the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer in 2023. We show how to isolate the three-photon contribution term from the two-photon contributions, in order to access $\\cos φ$.

We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\\rm H}$ and $n_{\\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\\rm OVI}$-$N_{\\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas--with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM."}

Predicting the results of experimental measurements in high-energy physics reactions serves a good example. The reaction rates and distributions of momenta of the final state particles, depend on the parameters of the underlying physics model in a non-trivial way. The conventional way to predict the experimental of observables is to use the Monte Carlo morphing technique on a finite discrete set of simulated samples. In this article we extend this technique by using the overdetermined morphing basis. We show that our approach yields a better result than the traditional technique in terms of the statistical power and uniformity of the resulting prediction, and delivers better precision. We further demonstrate that the overdetermined morphing is better suited for description of extended regions of phase space than the conventional morphing. We use the modelling of kinematic distributions of the final state particles produced in decays of non-Standard Model Higgs bosons as an example."}

To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M* and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z>8.

A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $Φ$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|Φ|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches."}

For the two spherical accretion models, the infalling scenario yields a darker shadow due to the Doppler effect. However, the shadow radius remains unchanged for different models. In the case of an optically thin, geometrically thin disk accretion model, the observed brightness is predominantly determined by direct emission. The lensing ring provides a secondary contribution to the intensity, whereas the photon ring's emission is negligible.

In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$ν$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds.

The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity."}

In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space."}

Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (>98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+."}

In order to discuss the physical origins of these variations, we incorporate gas- and dust-phase interstellar chemistry into galaxy-scale simulations with various baryonic physics including dust formation, evolution, and destruction, all of which are essential for the calculations of 400 interstellar molecule species. The new simulations can accordingly predict the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecular species such as H_2O and CO_2 ice within individual molecular gas cloud of galaxies based on gas density and temperature, dust temperature (T_dust), elemental abundances (e.g., CHNOPS), UV radiation strength (F_UV), and cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_CR) within the clouds. Since this is the first of the series of papers, we describe the details of the new simulations and present the preliminary results focused on the spatial distributions of H_2O, CO, CO_2, and CH_3OH ice species in a disk galaxy similar to the Milky Way. We particularly discuss how T_dust and gas-phase elemental abundances can control the spatial distributions of the above molecules in galaxies. We briefly discuss the total amount of H_2O and CO_2 ices and radial distributions of PN and PO molecules in the Galaxy."}

The model integrates the Peccei-Quinn symmetry with the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses. This allows for spontaneous leptogenesis, which generates the required $B-L$ asymmetry around the seesaw scale. The necessary initial axion kinetic misalignment is naturally sourced by a PQ field driving pole inflation. Analysis within the KSVZ axion model demonstrates that achieving simultaneous correct DM abundance and baryon asymmetry limits the axion decay constant to be smaller than about $10^9$ GeV. This framework offers a unified solution to four fundamental problems: the strong CP problem, neutrino mass, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and inflation."}

We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect."}

In gauge theories, the full potential of this tool is revealed when it is combined with the Slavanov-Taylor identities associated with the local gauge symmetry. Hence, it is desirable to have perturbative expansion of scattering amplitudes that combine the graphical nature of Feynman diagram expansion and the reations among various diagrams due to the Slavanov-Taylor identities. In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory. In this paper, we show that this surprising connection naturally emerges from Witten's open string field theory in the field theory limit."}

Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.\n  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity."}

Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property variations.The 160-250 $μ$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$μ$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $μ$m, potentially with ice mantles."}

This motivates implementing quantum aspects of gravity through an independent connection. Moreover, the experimentally confirmed violation of Bell inequalities, together with the natural structure of the energy--momentum tensor in semiclassical gravity, suggests that nonlocality should be incorporated into the gravitational formalism. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant. In the Newtonian regime, we analyze a situation in which the gravitational source is in a quantum superposition and find that the model predicts a novel, nonconservative effective force that depends on the velocity of the test particle."}

The calculation is carried out with a theoretical method where the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator is used for arbitrary momentum transfer in the scattering processes. Encoding the collision effect in a self-consistent manner, the resummed gluon propagator regulates the infrared divergence in the scattering amplitude without introducing an artificial cutoff for the transferred momenta and makes the analysis on the hard and soft processes in a unified framework. To place our computation on a more solid foundation, we also explicitly demonstrate the gauge independence of the interaction rate as well as the elimination of unphysical gluon polarizations by the ghost field under the use of the resummed gluon propagator. In addition, with our complete QCD calculation by including both quark-quark and quark-gluon scatterings, we provide a quantitatively reliable result on the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark where the new contribution from quark-gluon scatterings accounts for a larger portion of the total energy loss. In general, collisions between the thermal partons result in an increased energy loss which becomes more pronounced with increasing gauge coupling. Considering a typical coupling constant in QCD, $α_s = 0.3$, the energy loss increases $\\sim 8$% at large incident velocities as compared to the collisionless limit.

We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation."}

Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press", "summary": "A recent model prediction claimed that exists a correlation between the formation scenarios of globular clusters, i.e., whether they formed in situ, or in dark matter halos that were accreted into the Milky way, with some properties of their tidal tails, particularly, their widths ($w$), their dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum ($σ$$_{\\rm L_z}$ ), and in the line-of-sight ($σ$$_{\\rm V_{LOS}}$) and tangential ($σ$$_{\\rm V_{Tan}}$) velocities. I exploited the APOGEE DR17 data base and selected highly confident tidal tails members of 17 Milky Way globular clusters, for which the above four properties were computed for the first time. From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $σ$$_{\\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $σ$$_{\\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles."}

We investigate a degenerate modification of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric obtained through a coordinate transformation applied to the radial coordinate, analogous to recent approaches that address the Big Bang singularity via spacetime defects. The resulting metric, while formally satisfying the standard homogeneous Friedmann equations, actually describes an evolving wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker regions connected by a throat located at the coordinate singularity. Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -ρ/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor."}

These models provide an idealised description of globular clusters that rotate asynchronously with respect to their orbital motion around a host galaxy. Model construction proceeds by extension of the truncated King models, using a newly defined asynchronicity parameter to couple the tidal and rotational perturbations. The method of matched asymptotic expansion is used to derive a global solution to the free boundary problem posed by the corresponding set of Poisson-Laplace equations. We explore the relevant parameter space and outline the intrinsic properties of the resulting models, both structural and kinematic. Their triaxial configuration, characterised by extension in the direction of the galactic centre and flattening toward the orbital plane, is found to depart further from spherical symmetry for larger values of the asynchronicity parameter. We hope that these simplified analytical models serve as useful tools for investigating the interplay of tidal and rotational effects, providing an equilibrium description that complements, and may serve as a basis for, more realistic numerical simulations."}

Depending on the values of these parameters $V_{eff}$ becomes a double barrier potential. We quantize the model and obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We solve that equation using the WKB approximation and compute the corresponding probability ($TP_{WKB}$) that the wavefunction of the universe tunnels through the double barrier potential $V_{eff}$. We study how $TP_{WKB}$ behaves as a function of the parameters $A$, $B$, $σ$ and the radiation energy $E$.

We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $τ_λ \\propto λ^β$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays."}

This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique.

Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images.

VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares."}

Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions.

There has recently been considerable progress in the interpretation and precision calculation of these correlations, using a specific class of observables called energy correlators (EECs). These observables are most cleanly studied in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where they can be measured over their full angular range. Of particular interest are kinematic limits of the correlator, both collinear, and back-to-back, where the correlator exhibits scaling behaviors governed by specific operators in QCD. Resolving these scalings requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, which can be achieved by performing measurements on tracks (charged particles). In this paper we perform the first calculation of the track-based EEC over its entire kinematic range, achieving a record precision of of NNLL (collinear) + NNLO (fixed order) + NNNNLL (back-to-back) for the track-based EEC, and additionally incorporate the leading non-perturbative corrections and their resummation, including the Collins-Soper kernel computed using lattice QCD. We describe the breadth of physics probed by this observable, and highlight the impact of different components of our factorization theorem on the final distribution. Combined with recent measurements of the track-based EEC with archival LEP data, our calculation initiates the precision study of track-based observables at LEP, which will lead to new insights into the dynamics of QCD, and the precision extraction of its underlying parameters."}

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter.

In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity."}

The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be capable of discovering thousands of TDEs each year, allowing for a dramatic increase in the number of discovered TDEs. The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters. Black hole masses $5.5< \\log M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot < 8.2$ can be recovered with typical errors of 0.26 dex, with early coverage removing large outliers. Recovery of the mass of the disrupted star is difficult, limited by the degeneracy with the accretion efficiency.

Black hole mass measurements obtained from Rubin observations of TDEs will provide powerful constraints on the black hole mass function, black hole -- galaxy co-evolution, and the population of black hole spins, though continued work to understand the origin of TDE observables and how the TDE rate varies among galaxies will be necessarily to fully utilize the upcoming rich data set from Rubin."}

Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys."}

Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious\" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory."}

As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions.

In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space."}

A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $Φ$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|Φ|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches."}

In a previous publication, we obtained evidence for the standard scaling of axion string networks, showing that the number of horizon lengths of string per horizon volume asymptotes to an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant. In this article, we turn our attention to the axion spectra, studying spectra of all components of the axion current and their unequal time correlators.

We introduce a simple model based on an ensemble of string segments, which accounts for the general features of the spectra and time correlations.

Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.\n  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity."}

We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k <= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II."}

The system retains the current $j^μ$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^μ$ in such a general covariant form that $s^μ=au^μ+ bj^μ$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^μ=(s-bj^0)u^μ/u^0+ bj^μ$, where $s$ is the entropy density.

The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories.

In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity.

Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious\" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory."}

By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling.

Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_π(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart.

In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory.

Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context."}
