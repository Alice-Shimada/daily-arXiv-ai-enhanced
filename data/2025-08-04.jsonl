In particular, this allows us to\nconsistently eliminate all instantons in a local QFT via a suitable topological\ngauging of the (-1)-form symmetry. In two-dimensional U(1) gauge theories, this\nis equivalent to changing the gauge gruop to R. This makes both locality as\nwell as the instanton restriction explicit. We apply this to clarify the\nGross-Taylor string interpretation of the decomposition of two-dimensional pure\nYang-Mills. We also apply decomposition to study two-dimensional R gauge\ntheories, such as the pure R Maxwell theory, and two-dimensional supersymmetric\ngauged linear sigma models whose gauge groups have factors of R.

While recent studies have explored neural-network-based\nvariational methods for scalar field theory in position space, a systematic\nbenchmark of the analytically solvable Klein-Gordon ground state --\nparticularly in the momentum-space field basis -- has been lacking. In this\nwork, we represent the ground-state wavefunctional as a neural network defined\non a discretized set of field configurations and train it by minimizing the\nHamiltonian expectation value. This framework enables direct comparison to\nexact analytic results for a range of key observables, including the\nground-state energy, two-point correlators, expectation value of the field, and\nthe structure of the learned wavefunctional itself. Our results provide\nquantitative diagnostics of accuracy and demonstrate the suitability of\nmomentum space for benchmarking neural network approaches, while establishing a\nfoundation for future extensions to interacting models and position-space\nformulations."}

In addition, our results show that the\ndistribution of $\\psi(2S)$ in jets is an excellent discriminator to test\ndifferent predictions for the $\\psi(2S)$ LDMEs from various extractions. We\nfind a large disparity between the predictions from three different\ncollaborations showing that a more precise extraction of the $\\psi(2S)$ LDMEs\nmay be necessary."}

The starting\npoint is the Mellin Barnes resummation of the conformal partial wave expansion,\nwhere the moments are parametrized by open (Reggeon) and closed string\n(Pomeron) trajectories with slopes determined by experimental form factors and\nmeson/glueball spectroscopy. The forward limits are fixed by the empirical\nunpolarized and polarized parton distributions. Polynomiality, crossing\nsymmetry and support are satisfied by construction. After NLO DGLAP ERBL\nevolution to $\\mu=2$ GeV our analytic framework (i) reproduces some of the\ncurrently available lattice moments of $\\mathbb{E}$ and\n$\\widetilde{\\mathbb{H}}$ in the non singlet sector, (ii) predicts sea quark and\ngluon polarized moments that will be testable by forthcoming simulations and\nexperiments at Jefferson Lab and the future EIC, and (iii) yields axial and\nhelicity flip GPDs in $x$ space in reasonable agreement with lattice QCD."}

Detecting\neccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate\neccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian\ninferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass\ngravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four\nobserving runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using\nthe new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the\nexisting model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity\nconstraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in\nboth models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and\nparallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible\neccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20\nHz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for\nSEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides\nmoderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of\n$\\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on\neccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources\nare consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \\leq 0.011$\nto $e \\leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in\nGW190814."}
