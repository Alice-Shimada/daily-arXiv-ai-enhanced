IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better\nposition to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved\nstudent learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We\nalso emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by\nestablishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it\nworks across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call\non the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing\nvalidity and educational impact over consensus alone."}

To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces.

We evaluate Pro2Guard\nextensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and\nautonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early\non up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes\n(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to\n80.4% task completion.

While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations.

The two and three point\nfunctions at one-loop are computed. The gauge Ward identities are checked and\nthe conditions to assure gauge symmetry of this non-minimal framework is found\nto be the same of the usual QED. Induced terms are also investigated and it is\nshown that the non-minimal Lorentz-violating $a^{(5)}_F$-term of the fermion\nsector can induce radiatively a non-minimal Lorentz-violating term in the\nphoton sector."}

Yet many of\nthese systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions\nare made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but\nneglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework\nthat integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user\npersonalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to\nuser needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process\ntailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design,\nkey XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy,\nfairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that\nenhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences."}

This issue arises because explainability in\nsocial media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this\nvision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer\nby proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The\nproposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing\nexplanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed\nversion for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the\nfirst to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity\n(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will\nvalidate its impact on decision-making and trust."}

Unfortunately, malicious\nusers exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating\ndeepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is\npressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the\nmajority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and\nfake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family\nof generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative\nclasses and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of\nlarge pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.\nEffectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures\ninformation discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we\ndemonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve\nstate-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining\ncomputationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot\nsettings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,\nachieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline\nmethods."}

Martinez", "Vidya Manian", "Sudhir Malik"], "title": "Jet Image Generation in High Energy Physics Using Diffusion Models", "comment": "The paper is under review at IEEE Transactions in Nuclear Science", "summary": "This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion\nmodels for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision\nevents at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark,\ngluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset\nare mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are\ntrained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents.\nWe compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency\nmodels in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches\nbased on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The\nfidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including\nthe Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency\nmodels achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based\ndiffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in\ncomputational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for\nHigh Energy Physics (HEP) research."}
