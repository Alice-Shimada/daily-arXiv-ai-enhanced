From the fitted\namplitude, we extract a Sachs-like form factor F(t) and define a separable GPD\nmodel H_T(x, t) = h(x)F(t), with h(x) modeled as a normalized Beta-like\nprofile. This factorized ansatz satisfies the GPD sum rule and enables a direct\ntwo-dimensional Fourier transform to construct transverse spatial distributions\nq(x,b). We analyze how longitudinal shaping modulates transverse localization,\nand quantify spatial features using statistical diagnostics including mean\nradius, skewness, and kurtosis. The framework is reproducible, data-driven, and\napplicable to other transition channels, providing a physically interpretable\nmap from amplitude behavior to spatial structure."}

The tracelessness of\nthe field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for\nthe higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild\ncoordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that\nthe multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses\nspinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The\nhigher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some\ninteresting new features arising from the little group based identification of\nhigher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the\nvector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin\nrepresentations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields.\nHere the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package\ninto a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous\nspin scale $\\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de\nSitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal\nand we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant\nderivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we\ndescribe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation."}
