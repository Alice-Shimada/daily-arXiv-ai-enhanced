In particular, we argue\nthat the class of track integrals at any loop order is fixed by the recently\nfound $\\mathrm{\\widehat P}$-symmetries of Yangian type. All track integrals up\nto six external points (and four loops) are bootstrapped explicitly as well as\nthe full family of one-loop integrals at any multiplicity. Moreover, the\ntriangle tracks at generic loop order, which constitute the most generic family\nof track-type integrals, are bootstrapped in this way. The results are compared\nto the direct evaluation via a `spectral transform' from the integrability\ntoolbox that turns out to be particularly efficient for position-space tree\nintegrals in lower dimensions. We prove that all $\\mathrm{\\widehat\nP}$-symmetries of these integrals can be derived from the framework of\nAomoto--Gelfand hypergeometric functions, which applies to integrals in one and\ntwo dimensions.

However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal\nfrom radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground\nremoval, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for\ninstrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers,\nwhere we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to\ndirectly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding\nto input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to\nobtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to predict $\\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of\nPSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna\nlayout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed\nthese alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images\nwith the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF\nvariations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\\rm x_{HI}$, with\nerrors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and\ndiscuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based\nparameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve\nthe robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm\nsurveys.

By tracking both interior modes,\ntrapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object,\nand exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an\novertaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose\ninto ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward.

Existence of a Self-Acceleration", "comment": "12 pages, 2 appendices, comments are welcome", "summary": "We investigate the post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics of energy-momentum squared\ngravity (EMSG), with particular emphasis on the possibility of\nself-acceleration in $N$-body systems. A central challenge in matter-type\nmodified gravity theories, including EMSG, is the non-vanishing divergence of\nthe energy-momentum tensor, arising from the nonminimal interaction between the\nstandard and modified matter fields. This feature can, in principle, influence\nthe $N$-body dynamics. In our previous work [1], its effects on the\nexternal-dependent part of the motion were studied in an EMSG class known as\nquadratic-EMSG. Here, we extend the analysis to the\ninternal-structure-dependent contributions, namely self-acceleration. To this\nend, we relax the reflection-symmetric assumption adopted in [1] and derive the\ncomplete equations of motion for a self-gravitating body in an $N$-body system\nup to the first PN order. By introducing a suitable expression for the\ncenter-of-mass acceleration and employing virial identities, including one\nnewly emerging within the quadratic-EMSG framework, it is shown that\nself-acceleration vanishes. Furthermore, we establish a PN integral\nconservation law for the total momentum, demonstrating that, as in general\nrelativity (GR), EMSG admits a conserved linear momentum compatible with the\nabsence of self-acceleration. Binary pulsar experiments provide stringent\nbounds on self-acceleration, and our analysis shows that, within the present\nlevel of accuracy, EMSG is consistent with these constraints. Therefore, the\ntheory remains viable in the strong-gravity regime probed by binary pulsars."}

Re-submitted to A&A after (minor)\n  revision", "summary": "It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight\ncorrelation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as\nthe infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a\ndependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive\ngalaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less\nmassive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual\ncontamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not\ncaptured through \"radio-excess\" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we\naim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio\nluminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program\n\"AGN-sCAN\" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the\nIRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on\nlow-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations\nreach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio\nbrightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust\nAGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect\nfour VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest\nVLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when\nconsidering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good\nagreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite\nthe non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA\ndetections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely\nunaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from\nnon-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent\nIRRC."}

To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an\nabelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry\nspontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a\nsuitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the\nhypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT\nsignal, we need $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct\norder of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the\noverabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance\nthrough the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton\ndecays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the\ncorrect value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for\nsuper-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs)\nproduced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future\nproposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton\npotential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor\nrelation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an\narbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM\ndensity due to dilution from entropy injection.

However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal\nfrom radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground\nremoval, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for\ninstrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers,\nwhere we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to\ndirectly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding\nto input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to\nobtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to predict $\\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of\nPSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna\nlayout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed\nthese alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images\nwith the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF\nvariations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\\rm x_{HI}$, with\nerrors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and\ndiscuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based\nparameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve\nthe robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm\nsurveys.

We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$)\nand without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce\nthe majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age\nfunction we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\\sim$ 5000\n$M_{\\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We\nfind that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most\nlikely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in\nsurvivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses\nbelow 6000 $M_{\\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can\nprotect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and\nthereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared\nto the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the\n$C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which\nis a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between\nthe $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr\nthe effect of the GMCs cannot be detected."}
