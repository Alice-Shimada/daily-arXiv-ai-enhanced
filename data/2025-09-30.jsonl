With\nthis principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of\ncivilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels\nsufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do\nso. This consideration also leads to the expectation that no ETC will colonize\na large fraction of the Galaxy, even using robotic probes, and that there are\nno long-duration high-power beacons. However, there is a reasonable chance that\nwe may make contact on a short, by historical standards, timescale. This event\nwould be momentous, but could still leave us slightly disappointed. Such a\nUniverse would be less terrifying than either of the two possibilities in the\nquote generally attributed to Arthur C.

Using this method, we derive analytic\nexpressions for leading-order three-point energy correlators with equal and\nunequal energy weights, where the latter are crucial ingredients for projected\n$N$-point energy correlators. We also apply the recently developed technique of\nanalytic regression with lattice reduction as a way to bypass needing explicit\nexpressions for the singular limits. Bridging theoretical advances in\nscattering amplitudes with the renewed interest in weighted cross-sections, our\nwork opens the door to precision tests of QCD dynamics through analytic\nevent-shape predictions."}

To this end, we perform\na direct comparison of two codes (FIL, SpEC), which differ in many aspects,\nincluding the numerical methods and discretizations used and equations solved.\nWe find that despite these different approaches, the codes are -- within\ncurrent numerical resolution bounds -- fully consistent, and broadly comparable\nin cost for a given accuracy level. Our results indicate that the error in the\nwaveforms is primarily dominated by the hydrodynamic evolution, consistent with\nearlier findings in the literature. We also discuss current limitations and\ncost estimates for numerical relativity simulations to reach the accuracies\nrequired in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors."}

In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously\nleveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion\ninflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this\npaper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we\nallow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly\nblue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions\nleading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number\nof extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. As we\ndemonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair\ncreation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field\nproduction, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI\ncan fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper\nlimit on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most\nrealistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the\nhypercharge sector of the Standard Model.

The case of the Cosmic Web around the Virgo cluster", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Context. Bars are elongated structures developed by a large fraction of disk\ngalaxies in their central few kiloparsecs. However, the bar formation process\nis still not fully understood, particularly the role played by the galaxy\nenvironment in the formation and evolution of these structures. Aims. The aim\nof this work is to establish how the galaxy environment affects the evolution\nof bars by analyzing the bar structural parameters in a sample of galaxies\nlocated in three different galaxy environments: in the Virgo cluster, in\nfilaments in the Cosmic Web around it, and in the field. Methods. We performed\nstructural analysis using optical imaging from the DESI Legacy survey,\nmeasuring bar radii and disk scale lengths through Fourier analysis and surface\nbrightness fitting techniques. Results. After defining a homogeneous sample of\nbarred galaxies across the three different galaxy environments in terms of\ncolor and magnitude, the median bar radii were found to be 2.54 +/- 0.34 kpc,\n3.29 +/- 0.38 kpc, and 4.44 +/- 0.81 kpc in the cluster, filaments, and field\nenvironments, respectively. In addition, the median bar radii scaled by the\ndisk scale lengths was found to be 1.26 +/- 0.09, 1.72 +/- 0.11, and 2.57 +/-\n0.21 in the cluster, filaments, and field environments, respectively. These\nresults indicate that the galaxy environment has a significant influence on the\nstructural parameters of bars, with bars in high-density environments being\nshorter and less prominent than those in the field. Conclusions. Our findings\ncan be interpreted in terms of a slowing of the secular evolution of bars in\ndense galaxy environments. Barred galaxies located in clusters could experience\na reduced rate of bar secular evolution due to various physical processes that\noccur in high-density environments, such as gas stripping, strangulation, or\ntidal interactions."}

In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of black hole spectral instability triggered by random\nand deterministic metric perturbations. We investigate the dependence on the\nmagnitude, spatial scale, and localization of the metric perturbations in the\nP\\\"oschl-Teller effective potential, and discuss the underlying physical\ninterpretations. It is observed that small metric perturbations initially have\na limited impact on the less damped black hole quasinormal modes, and\ndeviations typically around their unperturbed values, a phenomenon first\nderived by Skakala and Visser in a more restrictive context. In the higher\novertone region, the deformation propagates, amplifies, and eventually gives\nrise to spectral instability and, inclusively, bifurcation in the quasinormal\nmode spectrum. While deterministic metric perturbations give rise to a deformed\nbut well-defined quasinormal spectrum, random perturbations lead to\nuncertainties in the resulting spectrum.

There are large uncertainties in the physical\ndescription of IA, and analytical calculations are often out of reach for weak\nlensing statistics beyond two-point functions. We present here a set of six\nflexible IA models infused directly into weak lensing simulations, constructed\nfrom the mass shells, the projected tidal fields and, optionally, dark matter\nhalo catalogues. We start with the non-linear linear alignment (NLA) and\nprogressively sophisticate the galaxy bias and the tidal coupling models,\nincluding the commonly-used extended NLA (also known as the e-NLA or\n$\\delta$-NLA) and the tidal torque (TT) models.

We find that the $\\delta$-NLA model has by far\nthe largest impact on most probes, at times more than twice the strength of the\nNLA. We also observe large differences between the IA models in under-dense\nregions, which makes minima, void profiles and lensing PDF the best probes for\nmodel rejection.

We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs\nin giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could\nexplain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major\nmerger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a\ngravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two\ncompeting effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become\nbound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil\nvelocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls\nback due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities.\nAt intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become\nimportant, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background\nstellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the\ngalaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have\nrealistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to\nobserved systems.

A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling\nto ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction.

In this study, we examine the\nproduction of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction\nwith the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the\nfield-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for\nmassless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal\npolarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations\nof motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us\nto address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production,\nincluding backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we\napply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass\nterms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The\npresent study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal\npolarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic\ninflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to\nenhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic\ncoupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases,\nthe primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse\npolarizations of the vector field.

A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling\nto ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses\na significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles\nthrough processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the\nproduction of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction\nwith the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the\nfield-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for\nmassless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal\npolarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations\nof motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us\nto address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production,\nincluding backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we\napply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass\nterms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The\npresent study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal\npolarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic\ninflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to\nenhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic\ncoupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases,\nthe primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse\npolarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling\nfunction, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and\nrapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime."}

In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a\ncanonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon\nradius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is\ndefined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius\ntreated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond\nto the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free\nenergy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an\nassociated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of\nblack hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which\nis independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the\nFokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by\nconsidering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale\nwith black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can\nbe used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black\nhole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes\nunder a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy\nbecome extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some\ntheoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing\nfunctions of the horizon radius are considered.

In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously\nleveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion\ninflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this\npaper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we\nallow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly\nblue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions\nleading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number\nof extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. As we\ndemonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair\ncreation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field\nproduction, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI\ncan fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper\nlimit on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most\nrealistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the\nhypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from\nthe fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also\nrequires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we\nidentify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the\naxion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all\nenergy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong\nbackreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll\ntrajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These\nobservations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice\nstudies."}

Built upon a hybrid of the principles of\nEvidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural\nNetworks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior\ndistribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent\nbased training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al.\n2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne\nIa distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and\nmutual consistency among the standard $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\\Lambda_s$CDM\nmodels.

It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations,\nis free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic\ndifferentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical\ncomponents in a way that scales well in model space. The modeler should simply\nwrite down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates much of the\nfriction in the process. SymBoltz enables up to 100x shorter model definitions\ncompared to browsing equivalent files in CLASS. Symbolic knowledge enables\npowerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the\nbackground and perturbations, generating the Jacobian matrix and its sparsity\npattern, and interpolating arbitrary expressions from the solution. Modern\nimplicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times, reducing\nslowdowns by taking long time steps, reusing the Jacobian and LU-factorizing it\nover several time steps, and using fast linear system solvers. Automatic\ndifferentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any\ninput, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods\nin large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and\nsensitivity analysis. These features are useful in their own rights, but also\nreinforce each other in a synergy. Results agree with established codes like\nCLASS and CAMB. With more work, SymBoltz can grow into an integrated\nsymbolic-numeric cosmological modeling environment with a large library of\nmodels that delivers differentiable output as fast as other codes. SymBoltz is\navailable at https://github.com/hersle/SymBoltz.jl with single-command\ninstallation and extensive documentation, and welcomes questions, suggestions\nand contributions."}

We show that\n$\\mathcal{K}$ is stabilized as a classical solution in the presence of a large\n$R$ charge, corresponding to internal angular momentum. This provides a\nmechanism to maintain a large hierarchy between UV and IR scales. We also argue\nthat the evolution of spacetime is determined by a balance between classical\nand quantum effects, leading to a cosmic scale factor $a(t) \\sim t$ and\nconstant dilaton at late times.

In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously\nleveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion\ninflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this\npaper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we\nallow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly\nblue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions\nleading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number\nof extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. As we\ndemonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair\ncreation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field\nproduction, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI\ncan fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper\nlimit on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most\nrealistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the\nhypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from\nthe fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also\nrequires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we\nidentify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the\naxion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all\nenergy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong\nbackreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll\ntrajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These\nobservations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice\nstudies."}
