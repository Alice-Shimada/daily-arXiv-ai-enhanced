The weak deflection angles are\ncalculated using the Gauss-Bonnet method. They decrease with increasing impact\nparameter b and charge Q, but gradually increase with increasing black hole\nmass m. Notably, the presence of a surrounding quintessence field in Rastall\ngravity leads to a higher deflection angle compared to Schwarzschild or\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes with positive Nq. The photon sphere and shadow\nof the black hole are analysed concerning the charge Q and mass m; they shrink\nas Q increases and expand with increasing m. We further analyse the quasinormal\nmodes of the black hole, explicitly derive the coordinate time Lyapunov\nexponent {\\lambda}c and the quasinormal frequency {\\omega}. In the eikonal\nlimit, the Lyapunov exponent ensures that the real and imaginary parts of the\nquasinormal modes can be expressed by the frequency and instability time scale\nof the unstable null circular geodesics.

If the dark Higgs boson is the lightest dark sector particle, it is\nexpected to be long-lived and decay into Standard Model particles via Higgs\nmixing.

Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that no\nDoplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) superselection sectors carry nonzero color charge,\nthereby providing a precise and mathematically robust characterization of\nconfinement in these theories. To fully capture the global gauge structure, we\nextend the observable net by incorporating nonlocal Wilson line operators,\nwhich encode string-like color flux configurations essential to the theory's\ntopological properties.

To understand the origin of this discrepancy,\nit is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment\nmodel that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars.\nIt is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined.\nThe primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the\npredictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance.\nBy combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical\nstructure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance\nas a function of $[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with\nobservational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and\nSMSS J0313-6708.

The Lagrangian of the model contains two chiral nonets, a\nquark-antiquark type and a two-quark two-antiquark type. The pseudoscalar and\nscalar glueballs are introduced through their connections with the axial and\nthe trace anomalies of QCD, respectively. It is found that in order to satisfy\nthe axial anomaly and at the same time accurately generate all seven eta\nmasses, it is necessary to include at least two pseudoscalar glueballs, a\nphysical one and an unphysical one that gets integrated out and yields an\neffective instanton-type term which is needed in generation of the eta masses.\nAt the leading order, which corresponds to keeping effective terms in the\nLagrangian that contain no more than eight underlying quarks and antiquarks,\nthe mass spectrum of the model is worked out and shown to be in complete\nagreement with experiment. The quark and glue contents of the isosinglet\nscalars below 2 GeV, and of the isosinglet pseudoscalars up to around 2.2 GeV,\nare analyzed in detail and their correlations with the scalar glueball\ncondensate are examined. Decay widths of isosinglet scalars as well as\ndifferent self consistencies within this framework are used to probe the\nglueball condensate and thereby estimate the quark and glue contents of these\nstates. In the pseudoscalar sector, the state that is dominantly made of glue\nis clearly a state with mass above 2 GeV. In the scalar sector, the\nidentification of glue contents is less certain and in principle the three\nisosinglets in the 1.5-2.0 GeV can contain substantial glue. These glue\ncontents are determined as functions of the scalar glueball condensate which is\nthe key quantity in this analysis."}

The cyclic\nevolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a\nperturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a\nsecond field that becomes massless at $\\phi= \\phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an\nenhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the\nway to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)\n- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the\nstring mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the\nNull Energy Condition (NEC).

Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been\nwidely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive\nstar-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack\nof systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI]\nlines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used\nobservations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885\nsources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between\nline luminosities of $\\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\\rm\nL^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit\nthe relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII\nlines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses\nis weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other.\nFor $\\rm \\alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\\ \\rm\n{M}_{\\odot}\\,({K}\\,{km}\\,{s}^{-1}\\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\\alpha_{\\rm [CI]} =\n3.9$ and $\\sim$$17\\ \\rm {M}_{\\odot}\\,({K}\\,{km}\\,{s}^{-1}\\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ ,\nrespectively.

Our relations for [CI](1-0) and\nCO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across\ndifferent redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these\ncorrelations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time."}

CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee\nSurvey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of\nwhich have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for\nmetallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other\nelements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We\ncarry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR>70 and 125\nwith lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe]\nabundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and\nglobal alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The\n[Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean\nmetallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05\ndex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show\nstrong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22.

The BGC metallicity distribution is\nbimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly\ndominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we\nfind only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe]\nof in and exsitu GCs.

The cyclic\nevolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a\nperturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a\nsecond field that becomes massless at $\\phi= \\phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an\nenhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the\nway to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)\n- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the\nstring mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the\nNull Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string\ncoupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle.

In\naddition, it relies on beyond-the-Standard Model physics active around the\nelectroweak scale: new physics coupling to the Higgs to make the electroweak\nphase transition first order, and a new mechanism of CP violation. The\nrelatively low energy scale at which electroweak baryogenesis occurs makes\ncertain aspects of the mechanism testable through collider experiments,\nelectric dipole moment measurements, and gravitational wave observations.\nHowever, scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis are increasingly challenged by\nresults from contemporary experiments. The developing experimental programs\nwill play a crucial role in either falsifying or detecting the new physics\nresponsible for electroweak baryogenesis. To achieve this, it is essential to\nmake precise predictions for the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding\nexperimental signatures within specific scenarios. This review aims to provide\na comprehensive overview of the rich physics involved in these predictions. Our\ngoal is to offer a practical computational guide, with a focus on recent\ndevelopments in the field."}

In this letter, we show that both\nmerging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses.\nThe observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally\naccommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once\ncosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter\nspace needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the\nexclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this\ninterpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing\nrun by the collaboration should detect ${\\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing\ntheir mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable\nof observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario."}

Steinhardt"], "title": "Instant Folded Strings, Dark Energy and a Cyclic Bouncing Universe", "comment": "39 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based\non components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under\nperturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the\nstring scale and string coupling $g_s \\ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic\nevolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a\nperturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a\nsecond field that becomes massless at $\\phi= \\phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an\nenhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the\nway to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)\n- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the\nstring mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the\nNull Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string\ncoupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In\nturn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and\ninitiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition\ninto slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic\nsingularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and\nrobustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of\nprimordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background."}

The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of\nmassless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m-de Sitter-like\n(RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and\nimaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$.

We further explore the\ndetectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on\nthe detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody\nfactor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability\nof wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the\nincrease of $Q$.

In this work,\nwe study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the\nstochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\\delta\nN$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and\nFokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the\nnoises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR\nsetup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude\nof noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via\nin-in formalism.
