We model a running coupling by\nconsidering a geometry with a warp factor that deviates logarithmically from\nanti-de Sitter (AdS). A novel aspect of our bulk metric is that it smoothly\ninterpolates between a Randall-Sundrum solution with a hard wall and a geometry\ncorresponding to a logarithmic running typical of gauge theories. By studying\nshockwave deformations of this metric, we compute a two-point energy correlator\nassuming a high-energy scalar source. This extends techniques recently\ndeveloped for correlators in asymptotically AdS geometries. We use numerical\nmethods to find the profile of shockwaves along the extra dimension, as it does\nnot admit an analytical form. The running coupling leads to a decay of the\ntwo-point correlator at small angular separation, unlike the flat correlator\none finds in AdS. In the back-to-back limit we observe an exponential falloff\nsimilar to other hard-wall models."}

Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS),\noffer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the\nformation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants.\nIn \\cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network\n(FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize\ndark star {\\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data\ntaken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\nIn this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to\nidentify {\\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's\nNIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real\ndata for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates\nrecently identified in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and\nreconfirm that indeed \\JADESeleven, \\JADESzthirteen, \\JADESfz, and \\JADESfo\nhave spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The\nmain advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte\nCarlo parameter estimator used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach\nintroduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster\nthan the traditional method used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN\nmodel we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian\nuncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data\nfor high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool\nfor probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution."}

MHD turbulence can be\ndecomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfv\\'en-each\ncontributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing\nand separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the\nlimited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we\nuse 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode\nenergy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find\nthat the Alfv\\'en and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and\ntogether dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the\nfast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions,\nmultiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We\nfurther introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional\nResidual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic\ndata. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct\nmorphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing\nanisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of\nisothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We\nfurther demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the\nmode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors\nof approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data."}

When analyzed in the context of General\nRelativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE)\nequation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$.\nHowever, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck\n2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom\ncrossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar\nfields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of\nfreedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in\nthe context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line\nwithin a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be\nachieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular,\nScalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable\nfeature.

The\nmain advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte\nCarlo parameter estimator used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach\nintroduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster\nthan the traditional method used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN\nmodel we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian\nuncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data\nfor high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool\nfor probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution."}

When analyzed in the context of General\nRelativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE)\nequation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$.\nHowever, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck\n2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom\ncrossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar\nfields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of\nfreedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in\nthe context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line\nwithin a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be\nachieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular,\nScalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable\nfeature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI\nDR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple\nparametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\\mu_G(z) \\equiv\nG_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$.

We focus on the complex scalar field with\ncanonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either\npreserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is\nwell known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such\na scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate\nthat going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate\nwith respect to the perfect fluid case.

By performing\na $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic\ntheory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent\ndimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the\ndS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting\ndiscussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$\ndeformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article\nwe consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We\ncompute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed\nboundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time\nwavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side.\nThe results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\\Delta$, and may\ntherefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal\nseries. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT\ncase, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in\ncosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic\ncounterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction\ncoefficients.

On the boundary, the field\noperator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right\nRindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both\nthese regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of\nthe energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one\npresents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and\nthe second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the\nboundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free\ngeometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the\nRindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the\nboundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion\ncondensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative\neverywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and\nthe energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region.\nFor a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions\n$D\\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero.\nThis behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the\ngeometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer.
