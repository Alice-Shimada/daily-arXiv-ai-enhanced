Mena-Valle", "Vicent Mateu", "Pablo G. Ortega"], "title": "A Precise $α_s$ Determination from the R-improved QCD Static Energy", "comment": "53 pages + appendices, 21 figures, 6 tables", "summary": "The strong coupling $\\alpha_s$ is determined with high precision from fits to\nlattice QCD simulations on the static energy. Our theoretical setup relies on\nR-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy by\nremoving its $u=1/2$ renormalon and summing up the associated large (infrared)\nlogarithms which, in combination with radius-dependent renormalization scales\n(called profile functions) extends the validity of perturbation theory to\ndistances up to $\\sim 0.5\\,$fm. Furthermore, we resum large ultrasoft\nlogarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization group evolution. We have\nchecked that the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher\nremnants in a non-symmetric way, hence we also account for this potential bias.\nOur estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is based on a random scan over the\nparameters specifying the profile functions and the treatment of R-evolution.\nWe also devise a method to statistically combine into a single dataset results\nfrom independent simulations which use different lattice spacing and cover\nvarious ranges, which can be used to carry out fits in a much faster way. We\nexplore the dependence of the extracted $\\alpha_s$ value on the smallest and\nlargest distances included in the dataset, on how R-evolution is treated, on\nhow the fit is performed, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From\nour final analysis, after evolving to the $Z$-pole we obtain\n$\\alpha^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1166\\pm 0.0009$, compatible with the world average\nwith similar incertitude."}

Giddings"], "title": "Gravitational dressing: from the crossed product to more general algebraic and mathematical structure", "comment": "10 pages + refs; 3 figures. v2 additional construction noted", "summary": "The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of\ntype III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational\ndressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending\n\"standard dressing\" constructions previously used to give a perturbative\ndefinition of \"gravitational splittings,\" defining approximate localization of\ninformation. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition\nis a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure\nassociated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves\nnoncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level\nconnects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity."}
