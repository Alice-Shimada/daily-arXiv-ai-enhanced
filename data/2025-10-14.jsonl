In this\nwork we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly\nincorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore\nits effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism\nwith an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized\nthrough the MFP.

We find that the\neffect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of\nreionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions\nby around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with\nanalytic models which do not account for the MFP.

Example implementation in the public GIZMO\n  code at: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html", "summary": "Many astrophysical simulations involve extreme dynamic range of timescales\naround 'special points' in the domain (e.g. black holes, stars, planets, disks,\ngalaxies, shocks, mixing interfaces), where processes on small scales couple\nstrongly to those on large scales. Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and\nhybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial,\nphysics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following\nthe long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical\ntimestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating\nsimulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling\nthis in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then\nprojected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming\nin and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is\nmodulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch\nfactor $a({\\bf x},\\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches\n(including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and\nensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and\nderive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to\nensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different\nphysics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes\nit possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear\nscale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is\nflexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and\nlimitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these\nmethods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be\nused to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in\nmultiphysics simulations."}

Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects\n(from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be\ngeneralised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and\nband. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS\nspectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data.

This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications."}

Instead, their locations correlate with $\\mathcal{R}$\n$\\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while\nfast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar\nlength and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by\ntheir ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific\nresonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are\nclosely associated with the corotation radius.

Rather than\nestimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign\nprobabilities of them being below $z=0.2$, the redshift limit of the subsurvey.\nThis is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping\nwith WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes\nfrom $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the\nclassification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We\ncheck the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide\nlimits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude\nthresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of\n94-95\\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close\nto the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic\ntraining sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply\nthe classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million\nphotometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands\nmeasured. Our work demonstrates that a machine-learning classifier could be\nused to select a flux- and redshift-limited sample from deep photometric data."}

Not nearly enough attention is given to understanding the\nmodels' robustness, especially when the test data are systematically different\nfrom the training data, or \"out of domain.\" Domain shift poses a significant\nchallenge for simulation-based inference, where models are trained on simulated\ndata but applied to real observational data. In this paper, we explore domain\nshift and test domain adaptation methods for a specific scientific case:\nsimulation-based inference for estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray\nprofiles. We build datasets to mimic simulation-based inference: a training set\nfrom the Magneticum simulation, a scatter-augmented training set to capture\nuncertainties in scaling relations, and a test set derived from the\nIllustrisTNG simulation. We demonstrate that the Test Set is out of domain in\nsubtle ways that would be difficult to detect without careful analysis. We\napply three deep learning methods: a standard neural network (NN), a neural\nnetwork trained on the scatter-augmented input catalogs, and a Deep\nReconstruction-Regression Network (DRRN), a semi-supervised deep model\nengineered to address domain shift. Although the NN improves results by 17% in\nthe Training Data, it performs 40% worse on the out-of-domain Test Set.\nSurprisingly, the Scatter-Augmented Neural Network (SANN) performs similarly.\nWhile the DRRN is successful in mapping the training and Test Data onto the\nsame latent space, it consistently underperforms compared to a straightforward\nYx scaling relation.

To investigate environmental effects, particularly the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA,\nyielding values from $(8.1\\pm4.7)\\times10^{-18}$ to $(2.0\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-16}$\ns$^{-1}$ ($N_{H_2}$ from $(1.7\\pm0.2)\\times10^{21}$ to\n$(3.6\\pm0.4)\\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$). This result favors theoretical\npredictions of a cosmic-ray attenuation model, in which the interstellar\nspectra of low-energy CR protons and electrons match {\\it Voyager}\nmeasurements, although alternative models cannot yet be ruled out. The\nabundance of CH decreases with increasing column density, while showing a\npositive dependence on the CRIR, which requires atomic oxygen not heavily\ndepleted to dominate CH destruction in PGCCs. By fitting the abundance of CH\nwith an analytic formula, we place constraints on atomic O abundance\n($2.4\\pm0.4\\times10^{-4}$ with respect to total H) and C$^+$ abundance\n($7.4\\pm0.7\\times10^{13}\\zeta_2/n_{\\rm H_2}$). These findings indicate that CH\nformation is closely linked to the C$^+$ abundance, regulated by cosmic-ray\nionization, while other processes, such as turbulent diffusive transport, might\nalso contribute a non-negligible effect."}

We examine\nhow neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data\nanalytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities\nthrough encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential\nequations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond\ntraining data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in\nbillions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and\nexpensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications."}

The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH\nemission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and\nionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local\nradiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z < 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs\nremains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed\nformation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS\nobservations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We\nconfirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and,\nfor the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region\nnearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the\ngalaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region.

When compared with models, mid-IR\nline ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a\ncombination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing\n4--8%.

Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and\nhybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial,\nphysics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following\nthe long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical\ntimestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating\nsimulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling\nthis in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then\nprojected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming\nin and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is\nmodulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch\nfactor $a({\\bf x},\\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches\n(including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and\nensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and\nderive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to\nensure good behavior.

In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the\nIDE model with $Q = \\beta H_0 \\rho_{\\rm de}$ gives $\\beta = -0.4170 \\pm\n0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\\sigma$ level. When replacing\nDESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\\sigma$ level, but\nremains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model\nwith $Q = \\beta H_0 \\rho_{\\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a\nmoderate-to-strong preference over $\\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive\nanalysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \\propto \\rho_{\\rm de}$\n(especially, $Q = \\beta H_0 \\rho_{\\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting\nthe existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological\ndata."}

We examine\nhow neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data\nanalytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities\nthrough encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential\nequations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond\ntraining data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in\nbillions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and\nexpensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications."}

Here, we present a\nclassification-based method to select the targets for WAVES-Wide. Rather than\nestimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign\nprobabilities of them being below $z=0.2$, the redshift limit of the subsurvey.\nThis is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping\nwith WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes\nfrom $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the\nclassification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We\ncheck the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide\nlimits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude\nthresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of\n94-95\\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close\nto the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic\ntraining sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply\nthe classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million\nphotometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands\nmeasured.
