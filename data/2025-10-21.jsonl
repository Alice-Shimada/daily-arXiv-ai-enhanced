After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate\nthrough the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale\ndistributions and driving galactic outflows.

In cold, dense gas,\nion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker\nnon-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and\nslower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code\nArepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the\nmultiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion\ncoefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics.

The second\ndirection is the transport of quarkonia, bound states of heavy quarks, where\nnovel Generalized Gluon Distributions have been recently defined and calculated\nin the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD. I discuss their application\nto the dynamics of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting the need to\naccount for non-Markovian effects in the interactions between the heavy quark\npair and quark-gluon plasma -- which have thus far resisted a systematic\ncharacterization."}

The dynamics of both photons and massive particles are analyzed\nin detail using the effective potential formalism, including particle\ntrajectories, the photon sphere, black hole shadow, and the innermost stable\ncircular orbits (ISCOs). Particular emphasis is placed on how the presence of\nthe KDM halo modifies these geometric and dynamical features. Furthermore, we\nexplore the topological characteristics of photon rings by constructing a\nnormalized vector field, following Duan\\textquotesingle{}s topological current\n$\\phi$-mapping theory, and demonstrate how this field is influenced by both the\nstring cloud and the KDM halo. In the thermodynamic context, we analyze the\nimpact of the KDM halo and the string cloud on the Hawking temperature, Gibbs\nfree energy, thermal stability, and phase transitions of the black hole.\nFinally, we examine the thermodynamic topology of the system using a\ntheoretical framework that incorporates a generalized Helmholtz free energy and\ntopological current theory. In both the photon sphere and thermodynamic\nanalyses, we show that the string cloud parameter shifts the location of the\nzero point of the vector field in the equatorial plane. Specifically, in the\nphoton sphere case, the radius of the photon sphere increases with increasing\nvalues of the string cloud parameter, while in the thermodynamic topology, the\nhorizon radius decreases as the string cloud parameter increases."}

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

However, the rarity of transient\nevents and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples\npose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB\nclassification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques,\nwhich inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising\nsolution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point\nsource injection strategies and their effects on classification performance\nwithin a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct\nvarious training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection\n(NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope\nNetwork datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on\nsimulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from\ngravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive\nexperimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus\nfiltering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g.,\nsupernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near\ngalaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a\nhigh false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these\ntrade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate.\nOur results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in\ndeveloping robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up\ncampaigns."}

This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and\ncosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave\nemitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first\nobserving run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer\ntechniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband\npersistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic\ndecomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent\ngravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints\nto date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity\nestimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times\n10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted\nsources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397\n-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1\n\\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$.

However, the dependence\nof heating efficiency on jet properties is not fully understood. In this work,\nwe present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like\ncluster, including both single-jet and self-regulated models, to investigate\nhow jet density affects bubble evolution and the thermal balance of the\nintracluster medium. Our results confirm previous findings that lighter jets\ninflate more spherical bubbles and are more easily deflected by cold gas,\nenabling isotropic energy deposition throughout the cluster core. However,\ndespite their broader spatial impact, lighter jets display lower overall\nheating efficiency, requiring higher average jet power to maintain\nself-regulation compared to heavier jets. We also find that the distribution\nand amount of cold gas significantly influence the effectiveness of jet\nheating. These results highlight jet density as a critical parameter in AGN\nfeedback and emphasize the need to incorporate additional physical processes\nsuch as magnetic fields, viscosity, and cosmic rays in future studies for\nrealistic comparisons with observations."}

This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the\nelectroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase\ntransition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase\ntransition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field\nslow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum.

A critical technical challenge is\nmitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the\nthird dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise\nis unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,\nmovable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be\nsubtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients\ncan be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise\nsubtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA\nyaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of\nrealistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)\nare yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations\nto generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration\ncapability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more\nfavorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the\naccuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency\ndata (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve\nestimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such\nas $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case\nof high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different\nsinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These\nmethods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the\nTTL noise subtraction."}

This paper\ninvestigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the\n(inverse) Gertsenshtein effect. To this end, we first determine the metric\nperturbation from Minkowski spacetime up to second order in the magnetic field\nstrength, assuming cylindrical symmetry.

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

This paper\ninvestigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the\n(inverse) Gertsenshtein effect.

We then consider new applications and study quantum\ncorrelations in several LHC final states: $t\\bar t W^\\pm$, $tW^-$ vs.\\ $t(\\bar\nt\\to W^- \\bar b)$, and $t\\bar t t$ vs. $t\\bar t t\\bar t$."}

This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and\ncosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave\nemitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first\nobserving run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer\ntechniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband\npersistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic\ndecomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent\ngravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints\nto date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity\nestimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times\n10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted\nsources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397\n-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1\n\\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$.

A critical technical challenge is\nmitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the\nthird dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise\nis unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,\nmovable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be\nsubtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients\ncan be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise\nsubtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA\nyaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of\nrealistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)\nare yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations\nto generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration\ncapability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more\nfavorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the\naccuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency\ndata (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve\nestimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such\nas $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case\nof high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different\nsinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These\nmethods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the\nTTL noise subtraction."}

In addition, it is found that the fracton mode remains\ngapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest\nthat fractonic excitations are inherently protected by the crystal-dipole\nsymmetry in solids and are qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime\nsymmetries."}
