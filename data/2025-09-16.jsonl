By supplementing Gaia\nphotometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility\n(ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the\nreported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that\nin all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model\nfails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than\nperiodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false\npositives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false\ndetections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at\nmost a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day\ntimescales.

We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and\ndusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from\nSDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission\nfrom WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were\ncomplemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures\ntraced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial\ndistribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha,\nand [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud.

In this paper, we explore, in detail,\na method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values,\nusing information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach\nenables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths\nobserved with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs\nper star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the\nlatter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing.

We show that the enhanced tail\nof the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an\nexponential sensitivity of $\\beta$ to the curvaton decay fraction\n$\\Omega_{\\chi,\\rm dec}$. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton\nfluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass\nspectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated\nstochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak\nfrequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate\nthat the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and\ngravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation\nmodels, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics\nto upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations."}

Two of these -- the\ninterchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological\ninformation to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these\nwe add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative\ninteractions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that\nquantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving\ngravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit,\nthe non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to\nbe suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed.

In\nmost studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the\ngalaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these\nrelations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a\nsubsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to\nanalyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar\npopulation age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and\ncircumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar\nvelocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These\ncorrelations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all\nmorphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic\nbars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar\nvelocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies.\nIt is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar\nmass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show\nyounger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the\ncentral regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star\nformation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between\nstellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their\nnuclear stellar populations are younger than expected.

We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological\nobservations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of\ngalaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon\nin the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be\neasily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when\ncoupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as\npredicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the\nUniverse's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that\nthe CCC parameter {\\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark\nmatter and dark energy, which we call {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy, and\nis influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically\n{\\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe,\ne.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme\nanisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions,\none expects {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low\nand vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from\nthe SPARC database and find the results promising."}

Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS)\nmisaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star\naligned controls.

As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the\n$F(R,\\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity\nsystem and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points.\nHowever, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the\ncombined $F(R,\\phi)$ system.

We present an analysis of these predicted radio\ngalaxy morphologies for the RGZ catalogue, classified using a pre-trained radio\ngalaxy foundation model that has been fine-tuned to predict Fanaroff-Riley (FR)\nmorphology. As seen in previous studies, our results show overlap between\nmorphologically classified FRI and FRII luminosity-size distributions and we\nfind that the model's confidence in its predictions is lowest in this overlap\nregion, suggesting that source morphologies are more ambiguous. We identify the\npresence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect\nto the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a\ncomparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those\nidentified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their\nselection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology.

Our model includes: (1) recoil\nvelocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass\nBH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of\nspin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar\ncluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing\nthe recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW\nrecoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population\nof off-nuclear (\"wandering\") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total.\nObservable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight\nvelocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

Two of these -- the\ninterchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological\ninformation to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these\nwe add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative\ninteractions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that\nquantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving\ngravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit,\nthe non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to\nbe suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed.

In contrast to conventional approach, where the\nseparation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization which breaks\nthe dual conformal invariance (DCI) of separate contributions, we use the\nregularization which is sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and\nanalytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization,\nthe contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method\ndramatically simplifies the calculations. As a demonstration, we calculate a\nslightly off-shell DCI pentabox integral up to power corrections. The\ncontributions of all 32 regions appear to be expressible in terms of\n$\\Gamma$-functions thus giving, after removing the regularization, the final\nexpression in terms of cross-ratios logarithms only.

For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum\nsignal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and\nreaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear\nlimit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum\nscales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation\nbispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing\na hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation\nfunctions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular\ndependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum\nquadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic\nangular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in\nfuture high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window\ninto tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe."}

We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals\ncan differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the\ninterchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological\ninformation to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these\nwe add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative\ninteractions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that\nquantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving\ngravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit,\nthe non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to\nbe suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed. They are\nnonetheless technically natural, as is particularly clear in the dual\nformulation. We argue that scalar fields arising as duals (such as the\nuniversal axion $a$ from string vacua) that have the commonly assumed $J^\\mu\n\\partial_\\mu a$ interaction with matter also have $J^\\mu J_\\mu$ contact\ninteractions among the respective currents, some of whose implications we\nexplore.

In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE,\nresolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be\naccompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the\ncosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich\nspectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\\simeq {\\cal O}(0.001))$.
