KIDs spanning 210 - 850 GHz across seven instrument\nmodules will be deployed in the Prime-Cam instrument of CCAT Observatory's Fred\nYoung Submillimeter Telescope at an elevation of 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in\nChile's Atacama Desert. The natural frequency-division multiplexed readout of\nKIDs allows hundreds of detectors to be coupled to a single radio frequency\n(RF) transmission line, but requires sophisticated warm readout electronics.\nThe FPGA-based Xilinx ZCU111 radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) offers a\npromising and flexible solution to the challenge of warm readout. CCAT uses\ncustom packaged RFSoCs to read out KIDs in the Prime-Cam instrument. Each RFSoC\ncan simultaneously read out four RF channels with up to 1,000 detectors\nspanning a 512 MHz bandwidth per channel using the current firmware. We use\nfive RFSoCs to read out the >10,000 KIDs in the broadband 280 GHz instrument\nmodule inside a testbed receiver. Here, we describe and demonstrate the readout\nsoftware and pipeline for the RFSoC system. We also present the preliminary\naveraged spectral responses of the 280 GHz instrument module using KIDs from\nthe TiN array and the first Al array as a demonstration of the end-to-end\nperformance of the readout and optical systems. These measurements demonstrate\nthe foundation that will enable us to simultaneously read out over 10,000 KIDs\nwith the RFSoC and represent a critical step toward reading out the ~100,000\nKIDs in Prime-Cam in its future full capacity configuration."}

We also examine how these properties vary\nwith simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated\nstar formation histories and are generally consistent with current\nobservational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\\sim 4.5$\nexcess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger\nrates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates\nfor $z \\lesssim 1$.

For\ncertain mass spectra of this sort, it has been shown that the evaporation of\nthese PBHs into radiation can drive the universe toward an epoch of\ncosmological stasis which can persist for a significant number of $e$-folds of\ncosmological expansion. However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which\ncharacterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently\nbe distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we\nexamine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a\nPBH-induced stasis. Within such stasis models, we find that mergers have only a\nnegligible effect on these spectra within the regime of interest for stasis. We\nlikewise find that the effect of accretion is negligible in many cases of\ninterest. However, we find that the effect of accretion on the PBH mass\nspectrum is non-negligible in situations in which this spectrum is particularly\nbroad.

Our\nframework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN\nwith Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo --\nto assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in\nsimulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN.\nArepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during\nsimulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The\nalgorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other\nsimulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we\napplied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG\nsuite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the\nresulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving\nmerger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor\nmass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary\nwith simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated\nstar formation histories and are generally consistent with current\nobservational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\\sim 4.5$\nexcess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger\nrates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates\nfor $z \\lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across\ndifferent formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the\nbinary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current\nobservational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our\nnovel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a\nfull cosmological context."}

In this case, simultaneously\nachieving enough dark matter relic abundance and proper matter-antimatter\nasymmetry limits the available parameter space of the model. Moreover, the\nscalar triplets are coupled non-minimally to gravity and give rise to the\ninflaton. We calculate the inflationary parameters and check that we can obtain\npredictions consistent with Planck constraints from 2018. We also perform an\nanalysis of the reheating for the inflaton decays/annihilations to relativistic\nSM particles."}

The James Webb Space Telescope, with its\nhigh spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique\naccess to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial\nmorphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the\nHorsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas\ntemperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study\nof H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the\nPDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction\nthroughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to\nthe second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in\ndifferent regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the\nobserved gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight\ndecline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the\nOPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho\nrovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and\npreferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the\nOPR.

However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which\ncharacterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently\nbe distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we\nexamine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a\nPBH-induced stasis.

Interestingly, we find that the\nenergy density of cosmic superstrings is generically very large when the\nmodulus is oscillating around its minimum, opening up the possibility of a\ndetectable gravitational wave signal. We also find no evidence of an efficient\nresonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings due to an oscillating tension in\nthe late time minimum."}

We employ the constant speed\nof sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between\nconfined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the\nrelativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial\noscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations\nbetween $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities\ndisplay a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that\nappear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime.
