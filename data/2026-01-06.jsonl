Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $Λ$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\\odot}$ is constrained to be $\\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations."}

From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \\WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $λ$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $Λ$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography."}

This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from \"standard\" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $Λ$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance."}

As benchmark examples, we analyse the bubble and triangle diagrams. The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function. We classify the kinematic singularities of these diagrams using Landau analysis, identifying novel types of singular behaviour, and validate this analysis against the explicit results. Finally, we derive a factorisation property of one-loop cosmological correlators at singular kinematics, relating them to flat-space loop amplitudes and lower-point tree-level correlators."}

We select the compact star EXO 1785-248 and analyze five different values of the coupling constant. To evaluate the physical feasibility of the model, we perform a graphical analysis of key properties, including the metric components, energy density, radial and tangential pressures, anisotropy, gradients, quark matter density and pressure, the equation of state parameter, energy conditions and the mass function. We further examine the stability and equilibrium of the star through parameters such as compactness, redshift, causality conditions, Herrera cracking, the adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.

The LMC:Milky Way (MW) interaction is also $\\sim$1:10, and is expected to perturb the MW's DM distribution. However, no framework exists to quantify the severity of these perturbations over multiple pericenters and longer periods of time, such as the LMC-SMC interaction history. We construct basis function expansions of a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Clouds interacting in isolation and analyze their DM distributions at an epoch approximating the time of infall to the MW. Our goal is to quantify how the Clouds distort each other's DM distributions without the MW. The LMC halo's response to the SMC includes a $\\sim 20$ kpc-long dynamical friction wake and the displacement of the LMC's density center during each SMC pericenter, which produces two overdensities in the LMC halo (at $\\sim$60 and $\\sim$100 kpc) at MW infall. The SMC's tidal radius at infall is just $\\sim4$ kpc, at which point the SMC has lost two-thirds of its initial DM mass to the LMC. The distortions to the Clouds' halos produce a highly asymmetric acceleration field. Accurate orbit integration in the LMC-SMC system must account for the time-dependent shapes of both halos. The SMC-induced perturbations in the LMC DM halo resemble the MW-LMC system, and persist over multiple SMC pericenters. We conclude that 1:10 satellite:host encounters induce characteristic deformations in both DM halos across all host mass scales, with implications for merger rates and tests of DM models."}

The transformation scales the lens mass distribution and superposes a uniform mass sheet, but this formulation offers no clear physical interpretation. Here I show that the MST follows directly from a scaling symmetry that becomes apparent when the ray-trace relation is written in proper-distance coordinates. In this form, the ray-trace relation isolates a geometric focusing term. Subtracting this term from the deflection law defines the Image-Selection Relation (ISR), which determines image positions, magnifications, and differential time delays. The ISR exhibits a scaling symmetry that leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays. Restoring the geometric focusing term then gives a ray-trace relation related to the original one by the Mass-Sheet Transformation."}

Comparing the time evolution of [CII] halos with bursty star formation histories of the simulated galaxies, we find that [CII] emission becomes more spatially extended following the decline of star formation rate in recent starburst episodes. This implies a strong correlation between extended [CII] emission and bursty star formation, consistent with a key role for star formation-driven outflows in producing [CII] halos -- though the kinematics of [CII]-emitting gas suggest that inflows and turbulent motions are also significant contributors. We also find a modest contribution from satellite galaxies to extended [CII] emission.

In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies."}

Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering."}

Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls.

This magnetic avalanche encodes the energy deposited in the initial excitation.

Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures. The resulting framework connects the extra scalar polarization to cosmological observables, providing a unified, gauge invariant link between gravitational wave phenomenology and the cosmological implications of metric f(R) gravity."}

The local (<200 pc away) young (<50 Myr old) stellar associations (LYSA) provide fundamental evidence for the study of the star formation process in the local neighbourhood. Aims. We aim at exploring robust statistical correlations in the internal kinematics of LYSAs and of these with age. Methods. We analyse a public data set containing the linear velocity field parameters and expansion ages of 18 LYSAs. We identify the most robust correlations using frequentist and Bayesian methods. Results. Among the 45 correlations, we identify only four that passed both frequentist and Bayesian criteria, with these four related to radial motions in the Galactic Z direction. We hypothesise several origins for these four correlations and identify the gravitational potential of the Galactic disk as the most likely driving element. It imprinted the observed motions in the parent molecular clouds, and once the stars were formed, it also damped these motions on a timescale shorter than the LYSAs' ages. Conclusions. The internal kinematics of local young stellar associations contain fundamental information about the star-formation process that is not fully addressed by star-formation theories, in particular, rotation and shear. Although the Galactic potential appears to be the driving force of these correlations, we urge the theoretical community to provide predictions about the internal motions of expansion, rotation, and shear of stellar associations."}

We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $λφ^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds."}

Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters."}

A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation.

The reduced-parameter formulation, developed within the relativistic Dirac formalism and employing a Martin-like potential, is then applied to the spectroscopy of the singly heavy baryons $Ξ_c^0$ and $Ξ_b^-$. This enables an explicit verification of the linear relation obtained between the potential parameters. Radially and orbitally excited state masses are calculated, and the resulting Regge trajectories are used to assign spin-parity to experimentally observed states. The states $Ξ_c^0(2923)$, $Ξ_c^0(3080)$, $Ξ_c^0(2882)$, and $Ξ_c^0(2970)$ are identified as having $J^P = \\tfrac{1}{2}^-$, $\\tfrac{3}{2}^+$, $\\tfrac{3}{2}^-$, and $\\tfrac{1}{2}^+$, respectively, while the observed $Ξ_b^-(6227)$ state is assigned $J^P = \\tfrac{5}{2}^+$. To investigate the electromagnetic structure of these baryons, their magnetic moments and radiative decay widths are computed. Additionally, the two-body weak decay branching ratios of $Ξ_c^0$ are evaluated and contrasted with experimental data to assess the robustness of the approach. The two-body nonleptonic decays of $Ξ_b^-$ are also analyzed, providing predictions for branching ratios that may be tested in future experiments. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the parameter-reduction procedure and support its applicability in the spectroscopy of baryons."}

Recent progress in the investigation of flat cosmological models in Lovelock gravity unveiled the fact that in quadratic (Gauss--Bonnet) and cubic Lovelock gravities, the higher-order power-law solutions could play the role of both future and past asymptotes, and under some conditions, there could exist a smooth transition between them. So it is natural to question if this feature is unique to Gauss--Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities, or if it is a general feature of Lovelock gravity. Our analysis suggests that starting from quartic and in all higher-order Lovelock gravities, the high-order Kasner solution cannot play the role of a past asymptote, not only preventing the abovementioned transition from happening, but also potentially hindering the possibility of reaching viable compactification."}

The X-ray observations have constituted a unique way to measure the element abundance and composition of the ICM due to their prominent emission lines in the 0.1-10 keV range. We explore the metal abundances and chemical enrichment in the cool-core galaxy cluster, Ophiuchus, by using a 217 ks XRISM data set. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni are accurately determined using high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that the average uncertainties of chemical composition, which are reported as X/Fe ratios, are only 10-20%. The X/Fe abundance pattern of the Ophiuchus centre is remarkably consistent with solar, which is reminiscent of the Hitomi constraint on the Perseus core. The observed abundance pattern can be replicated globally by linear combination models of core-collapse, including massive progenitors, and Type Ia supernovae. While nucleosynthesis models typically underestimate the Ca/Fe ratio, a substantial contribution of Ca-rich gap transients may help improve the deficit of Ca. High-resolution spectroscopic data can enable us to estimate the underlying impact on the chemical enrichment from subclasses of Type Ia supernovae."}

We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy."}

Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope."}

In this primarily expository article, we spell out some details about this construction. The axion wormhole has a semiclassical description, found in the original paper [1], in which the matter system is a two-form gauge field B with three-form field strength H=dB. The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to compute the effective action derived from the wormhole in the scalar (or two-form) language, recovering standard claims."}

By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \\textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability.

The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass.

Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b ~ 1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b ~ 0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (~ half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b ~ 0.4 and b ~ 1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (~ 10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b > 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b ~ 0.4-0.5."}

The analytical method compares well with DDSCAT numerical calculations and, under limited circumstances, with those made using the Bruggemann effective medium theory (EMT).The analytical method presented here provides a useful tool to explore the optical and polarisation properties of core/mantle spheroidal particles at long wavelengths (lambda >~ 8mu) and is simpler and faster to implement than corresponding numerical methods. We caution against the use of EMT methods in approximating the optical properties of core/mantle particles."}

The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional échellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $ρ$ Coronae Borealis ($ρ$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments."}

Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b ~ 1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b ~ 0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (~ half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b ~ 0.4 and b ~ 1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (~ 10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b > 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b ~ 0.4-0.5."}

We then investigate the subsequent motion of charged particles in the electric Penrose process, and rigorously prove that under specific simplified conditions, the resulting fragment particle can always carry more energy back to a distant observer--a conclusion applicable to a wide range of charged black hole models. Finally, we examine a special class of the electric Penrose process, wherein the initial particle cannot escape the black hole, but the high-energy fragment produced through splitting may still escape successfully. Moreover, it is observed that $ζ$ slightly alters the particle trajectories, but under specific initial conditions, it can qualitatively change the outcome: a particle that escapes in the classical Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime may become trapped in the quantum-corrected one.

In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable."}

Specifically, $ζ=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0<ζ<1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $ζ$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $ζ=1$ theory.

The bulk action in $AdS_{d+1}$ has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry and is obtained from the evolution operator of the Polchinski's ERG equation by a map that involves a field redefinition and requires a $\\textit{special}$ form of the UV cutoff function in the ERG equation. In this paper, we show that for $\\textit{any form}$ of the cutoff function, the ERG evolution operator has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry.

Particle jets produced in proton-proton collisions consist of cascades of particles originating from a common hard interaction. Each jet constituent is represented as a point in a three-dimensional feature space defined by the relative transverse momentum and angular coordinates with respect to the jet axis, yielding a point cloud description of each jet. Persistent homology is computed using a Vietoris-Rips filtration to obtain persistence diagrams, which are subsequently converted into persistence images for the H0 and H1 homology groups, corresponding to connected components and loop-like structures, respectively. These persistence images are used as inputs to a convolutional neural network for quark-gluon jet classification. Using the publicly available HLS4ML jet dataset, we find that persistence images derived from H0 and H1 individually exhibit comparable discriminative power. These results demonstrate that loop-like topological features, which are not conventionally exploited in jet tagging, encode meaningful information about jet substructure and provide a promising direction for topology-informed jet classification."}

We observed the $J_{K_aK_c}$ transitions of para-H2CO (within its J = 3-2 and 4-3 states) with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) 12 m submillimeter telescope using the nFLASH230 and SEPIA345 receivers towards a sample of 61 HII regions.

Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics.

Extracting these invariants means not only finding the general solution of the field equations of the model, but also obtaining the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions for the model whose dynamics acts like the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional mini-super space \\(\\mathbb{Q}=(a)\\). In addition, to obtain the general solution of the model, the IHJM have also solved the inverse problem of calculus of variation (IPCV) without resorting to Helmholtz conditions and whether the necessary conditions for the existence of the Lagrangian function are hold or not. The main part of the IHJM is to find the generating function of the canonical transformation (CT) and then extract two independent invariants for the desired model by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). This study shows that there is a close relationship between the group of the CTs of the Hamiltonian function of the particle and the one-parameter Lie group of transformations keeping invariant the Einstein-Friedmann dynamical equation (EFDE) \\(\\ddot{a}=F(a,\\dot{a})\\), so that both of them lead to the same result.

In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable."}

We explore the metal abundances and chemical enrichment in the cool-core galaxy cluster, Ophiuchus, by using a 217 ks XRISM data set. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni are accurately determined using high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that the average uncertainties of chemical composition, which are reported as X/Fe ratios, are only 10-20%. The X/Fe abundance pattern of the Ophiuchus centre is remarkably consistent with solar, which is reminiscent of the Hitomi constraint on the Perseus core. The observed abundance pattern can be replicated globally by linear combination models of core-collapse, including massive progenitors, and Type Ia supernovae. While nucleosynthesis models typically underestimate the Ca/Fe ratio, a substantial contribution of Ca-rich gap transients may help improve the deficit of Ca. High-resolution spectroscopic data can enable us to estimate the underlying impact on the chemical enrichment from subclasses of Type Ia supernovae."}

So it is natural to question if this feature is unique to Gauss--Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities, or if it is a general feature of Lovelock gravity.

Our result show that for the non-rotating case, the shadow remains perfectly circular, with its radius independent of the deformation parameter. For the rotating case, the size of the shadow decreases as the deformation parameter decreases, and the shape of the shadow gradually becomes more flattened. It is worth noting that while the shadow of a rotating black hole remains north-south symmetric for equatorial observers, this symmetry is broken once the observer moves away from the equatorial plane. For an observer in the northern hemisphere, the geometric center of the shadow shifts northward when $D_0<0$ and southward when $D_0>0$, while the opposite behavior occurs for observers in the southern hemisphere.

Case of low masses", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate the accretion of globular cluster stars on early cosmological timescales through detailed N-body simulations of theoretical GC models to assess the role of this mechanism in Milky Way-like galaxies. For the dynamical modelling, we used the updated parallel N-body code phi-GPU, including stellar evolution. We prepared three sets of GC models with different half-mass radii (r_hm), each consisting of 50 full N-body GC models, and integrated these models in an external, time-variable MW-like potential taken from the cosmological database IllustrisTNG-100. The simulations cover the time interval from -10 Gyr to -5 Gyr, enabling us to assess the rate of early stellar accretion onto the proto-NSC. We find that GC models with average orbital eccentricities of 0.4-0.5 and orbits oriented perpendicular to the galactic disc contribute most significantly to the mass of the proto-NSC formation. Accretion is especially efficient in the first billion years and in compact GC models with r_hm = 1 pc. In all sets, the dominant accreted stellar population consists of low-mass stars (~0.33 Msun). However, the accreted mass alone is insufficient to fully account for the current NSC mass. Based on our extended set of numerical simulations, we obtained an average lower limit of mass contribution (~6 percent) to the NSC from investigated GCs. The fraction of mass contribution from individual disrupted GCs can significantly vary from 0.1 percent up to 90 percent. Generally, we conclude that the GC stellar accretion channel alone might not be sufficient to ensure the present-day MW galaxy NSC mass budget."}

In contrast, the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1$-$0) emission appears more clumpy and localized. The non-thermal motion in the filament is predominantly subsonic to transonic. We detect 13 dense cores in NH$_2$D (1$_{11}-1_{01}$), three of which coincide with continuum peaks; virial analysis suggests most are gravitationally bound. Using a friend-of-friend algorithm, we identify 32, 34, and 22 velocity-coherent fibers from the CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, respectively. Compared to fibers traced by CS and HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ fibers are more frequently associated with NH$_2$D cold cores and exhibit higher average mass-per-unit-length values. Differences among CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emissions likely arise from variations in effective critical densities.

In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass.

Further, we investigate the phase transitions and critical phenomena in Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at the critical points. Such black holes are characterized by its mass ($M$), the dilaton charge ($Q$), and the negative cosmological constant, $Λ(<0)$. We define a dimensionless parameter $ε=\\bar{J}/{\\bar{Q}^2}$ and express the mass, temperature, volume, and Gibbs free energy in terms of $ε$ and its polynomials. Moreover, we numerically fit the data for the critical points and find that in the appropriate limit, the expressions for critical points would correspond to the respective critical points of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. Such a study involves a systematic analysis of temperature, Gibbs free energy, and volume in the extended phase space. We provide an analytical verification of the nature of the phase transitions at the critical points by introducing the Ehrenfest equations. We also check that all three quantities, e.g., the specific heat at constant pressure, $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient, $α$, and the isothermal compressibility, $κ_T$, diverge at the critical points. We find the $Prigogine$-$Defay$ ratio using the expressions of $C_P$, $α$, and $κ_T$, and find that it identically equals unity. Hence, the phase transition behavior of the Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at their critical points is of second order. In addition, we propose investigating the energy extraction process via the Penrose process. Later, we calculate the speed of sound and adiabatic compressibility for the rotating Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes.

Within this framework the Berry curvature associated with the infrared cloud carries a quantized functional flux, providing a simple and structural origin for the exponential form of the Isgur-Wise function in single-recoil transitions. Sequential processes such as $B \\rightarrow D^{**} \\rightarrow D$ probe two independent recoil directions and explore a two-dimensional region of the adiabatic manifold. In this setting the quantized flux naturally leads to a minimal non-Abelian structure which can be described effectively by an SU(2) holonomy. Heavy-quark form factors then appear as channel-dependent projections of two universal geometric modes, giving rise to correlated slopes, non-factorizable curvature in the $(w_{1},w_{2})$ plane, and characteristic angular patterns. These features are consistent with the symmetry structure of HQET while providing additional correlations among excited channels. The resulting framework offers a complementary viewpoint on heavy-quark phenomenology and suggests several experimentally testable signatures in multi-step semileptonic transitions."}

In this paper, we investigate two types of cycles--the Carnot cycle and the rectangular cycle--based on the phase diagram derived from the equation of state, to study the heat engine characteristics of the FRW universe. Furthermore, we calculate the work done and assess the corresponding efficiencies, illustrating the efficiency diagram for the FRW universe's heat engine. We observe that the efficiency of the rectangular cycle consistently remains below unity and never exceeds the Carnot efficiency--the thermodynamic upper limit.

The eccentricity with which binaries form in galactic mergers is the key parameter determining their evolutionary timescale from pairing to coalescence. However, accurately determining the binary eccentricity at formation is difficult in simulations due to stochastic effects. We present a numerical study of the formation and evolution of MBHBs that are potential PTA sources. We simulate mergers of equal-mass galaxies on different initial orbits and follow the dynamics of the MBHBs through the hardening phase. We find that low-resolution simulations are affected by stochasticity due to torques from the stellar distribution acting at pericentre passages. The dispersion in binary eccentricity decreases with increasing central resolution, as expected for a Poisson process. We provide a fitting formula for the resolution requirement of an N-body simulation of MBHB formation and evolution as a function of the initial eccentricity of the merger, e0, and the required accuracy in the binary eccentricity, eb. We find that binaries experience a torque at first pericentre that is approximately independent of initial eccentricity, producing a general trend in which the binary eccentricity decreases above sufficiently large initial orbital eccentricities. While this behaviour is generic, the precise cross-over eccentricity (e0~0.97 in our models) and the sharpness of the drop-off depend on the galaxy initial conditions. We provide a fitting formula for eb(e0) that can be used in semi-analytical models to determine the merger timescales of MBHBs as well as the amplitude and slope of the GWB."}

We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators. These correspond to non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. We demonstrate this explicitly in the rotating BTZ black hole by showing that the interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator and motivate a picture for how these contributions arise in higher dimensions.

This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge and in a background with or without a cosmological constant. Moreover, a new quasilocal prescription is proposed and tested, where the black hole partition function is determined solely by the horizon boundary term, yielding the correct Helmholtz free energy without the need for counterterms."}

In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass.

For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained.

The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded.

The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments."}

To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \\cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation.\n  In \\cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \\cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency."}

We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is more centrally located. We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated.

As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $Δ_γ- Δ_a \\approx n m_a$ ($n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $Δ_γ\\approx Δ_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion."}

Our analysis suggests that starting from quartic and in all higher-order Lovelock gravities, the high-order Kasner solution cannot play the role of a past asymptote, not only preventing the abovementioned transition from happening, but also potentially hindering the possibility of reaching viable compactification."}

Phenomenologically, 5-dimensional realisations permit new particles with masses as low as the TeV scale, well below the usual unification scale.

We show that current measurements are not sensitive to this class of models.

Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails\" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere. This work provides a wave-optics perspective on the interaction between dynamic sources and black holes, offering a table top window on strong gravitational lensing."}

From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \\WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $λ$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $Λ$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography."}

After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies."}

Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists."}

Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope."}

The equilibrium conditions for the system are discussed and the role of the thermodynamic ensemble used to describe the system is highlighted. Finally, we construct the electric susceptibility in a simplified hadron resonance gas model, relevant for the strongly interacting medium in the low-temperature regime."}

Within this framework the Berry curvature associated with the infrared cloud carries a quantized functional flux, providing a simple and structural origin for the exponential form of the Isgur-Wise function in single-recoil transitions. Sequential processes such as $B \\rightarrow D^{**} \\rightarrow D$ probe two independent recoil directions and explore a two-dimensional region of the adiabatic manifold. In this setting the quantized flux naturally leads to a minimal non-Abelian structure which can be described effectively by an SU(2) holonomy. Heavy-quark form factors then appear as channel-dependent projections of two universal geometric modes, giving rise to correlated slopes, non-factorizable curvature in the $(w_{1},w_{2})$ plane, and characteristic angular patterns. These features are consistent with the symmetry structure of HQET while providing additional correlations among excited channels. The resulting framework offers a complementary viewpoint on heavy-quark phenomenology and suggests several experimentally testable signatures in multi-step semileptonic transitions."}

In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass.

The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function.

The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events.

The color-octet quark matter corresponds to the $q\\bar q$ quark matter as envisaged in the realm of present knowledge but the color-singlet quark matter is as yet unexplored and now submitted for exploration. The color-singlet quark matter with two flavors can be separated into charged and neutral color-singlet quark matters. In the neutral color-singlet quark matter, the quark and the antiquark interacting only in the QED interaction may form stable and confined colorless QED mesons non-perturbatively at about 17 MeV and 38 MeV (PRC81,064903(2010) and JHEP(2020(8),165). It is proposed that the possible existence of the QED mesons may be a signature of the neutral color-singlet quark matter at $T=0$. The observations of the anomalous soft photons at CERN, and the anomalous bosons with mass about 17 MeV at ATOMKI, DUBNA, and HUS, and mass about 38 MeV at DUBNA hold promising experimental evidence for the existence of such QED mesons, pending further confirmations."}

We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $λφ^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds."}

The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \\textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability.

We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators.
