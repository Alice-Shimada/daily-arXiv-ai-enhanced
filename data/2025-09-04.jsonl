In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are\nused to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large\nenough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass\nhaloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect\non the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark\nmatter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per\ncent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations.\nWe propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its\nparameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects\ntwo orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual\nobjects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the\npopulation is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available\nconstraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our\nexperiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in\nthe lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly\ndegenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with\nindividual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding\nof the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information\ncan be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference."}

Here, we compare the results of this perturbative\ncalculation to full Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star\nparticles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that\nFDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of\na dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations,\nand that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are\nindeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by\npossible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal\nradius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show\nthat the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM\nself-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale\nstructure.

Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that\nlow-velocity (< 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are\ngravitationally retained in >10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such\nclusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering\na rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions,\nmapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed\nsecond population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated\ngas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by\nencounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is\naccreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle\naccretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs\nand neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that\nlower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range\nrequired to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the\nmultiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the\nsecond-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population\nstars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed\nretained gas.

In particular, Hubble residuals display a\nluminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often\nused as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here\nwe investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II\n$\\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide\nthe sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated\nat 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links\nbetween Si II $\\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour\n$c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or\nprogenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between\nthe Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \\pm 0.024$\nmag ($6.3\\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \\pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\\sigma$),\nconsistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\\sim 2.2\\sigma$. The\nclearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR} < 1$), where\nNV SNe Ia show a strong mass step but HV SNe Ia none, yielding a\n$3.1-3.6\\sigma$ difference. A host-colour step appears for both: NV $0.142 \\pm\n0.024$ mag ($5.9\\sigma$) and HV $0.158 \\pm 0.042$ mag ($3.8\\sigma$). Overall,\nNV and HV colour steps are consistent. HV SNe Ia show modest ($\\sim\n2.5$-$3\\sigma$) steps in outer regions ($d_{DLR} > 1$), while NV SNe show\nstronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally\nsensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV\nSNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step\ncorrection could introduce biases.

We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing\nthe time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified\nassumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR\ntransport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from\nbursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially\nalter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies\n($\\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a\nsignificant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies\n($\\gtrsim M_{\\textrm{halo}} \\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$), and we speculate that these\ntime-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio\nCircles\".

This work is related to the black hole\ninterior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically\nsymmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior\nvolume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a\nspace-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$.\nUsing this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is\nproportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this\nformulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of\ninfalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of\nHawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the\ncharged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical\nanalysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the\nvolume linearly increases with advancing time.\n  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the\nentropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black\nhole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black\nhole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality\nconstant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy\nis less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note\nthat these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than\nthe Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand\nthe uncertainty relation."}

Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of\nstars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use\nthe TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy\nmasses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs.

The\nmechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type\ngalaxies that are present and active at $z>1.5$ as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The\nprocess is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes\n(heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\\approx10-30$) orbital\nperiods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than\nat the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as\na proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and\nproperties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields,\nshow that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than\nlate-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed.

We derive the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming\ngalaxies at z <= 0.2 using 12-band optical photometry from the third data\nrelease (DR3) of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) over\n3,284 deg^2. Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag\nand photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z <= 0.20. Stellar masses and\nstar formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting\nwith CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as\nstar-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nadopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using\nthe 1/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions.\nResults. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and\nagree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic\nmass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that\nof star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming\ngalaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent\nfraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ > 0.95 at\nlog(M*/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an\nexcess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3\nstellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the\nliterature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models.\nQuiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9,\nbut 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including\n7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more\naccurate SED fitting and galaxy classification."}

Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\\sim30^\\circ$) and narrow\n($\\sim1.2^\\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our\ngoals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3\ncandidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members;\nand 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW\nor the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network\nclassifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through\na cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve\nstream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby\naccounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify\n1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's\napparent width has grown from $\\sim1.2^\\circ$ to $\\sim3$-$4^\\circ$ compared to\nprevious studies.

This work is related to the black hole\ninterior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically\nsymmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior\nvolume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a\nspace-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$.\nUsing this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is\nproportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this\nformulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of\ninfalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of\nHawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the\ncharged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical\nanalysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the\nvolume linearly increases with advancing time.\n  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the\nentropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black\nhole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black\nhole is proportional to the lack hole surface area.

In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are\nused to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large\nenough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass\nhaloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect\non the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark\nmatter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per\ncent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations.\nWe propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its\nparameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects\ntwo orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual\nobjects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the\npopulation is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available\nconstraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our\nexperiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in\nthe lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly\ndegenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with\nindividual subhaloes.

In CR work, a spherically\nsymmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior\nvolume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a\nspace-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$.\nUsing this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is\nproportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this\nformulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of\ninfalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of\nHawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the\ncharged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical\nanalysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the\nvolume linearly increases with advancing time.\n  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the\nentropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black\nhole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black\nhole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality\nconstant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy\nis less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy).
