We apply this to clarify the\nGross-Taylor string interpretation of the decomposition of two-dimensional pure\nYang-Mills. We also apply decomposition to study two-dimensional R gauge\ntheories, such as the pure R Maxwell theory, and two-dimensional supersymmetric\ngauged linear sigma models whose gauge groups have factors of R.

As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts\nself-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into\nconcise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.\nBesides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent\nknowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its\nability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,\ndata-driven process as \\textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent\nincrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing\nmodel parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging\nknowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,\nMetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or\nexceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving\nagentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag\nassumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex\nsystems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline.

This issue arises because explainability in\nsocial media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this\nvision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer\nby proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The\nproposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing\nexplanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed\nversion for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the\nfirst to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity\n(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will\nvalidate its impact on decision-making and trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unfortunately, malicious\nusers exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating\ndeepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is\npressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the\nmajority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and\nfake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family\nof generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative\nclasses and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of\nlarge pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.\nEffectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures\ninformation discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we\ndemonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve\nstate-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining\ncomputationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot\nsettings.
