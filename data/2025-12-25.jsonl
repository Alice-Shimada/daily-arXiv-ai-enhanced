In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident."}

In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn.

Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime."}

We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^φ) = R + αT^φ+ β(T^φ)^2/2$, in which the parameters $α$ and $β$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties.

Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the \"mass step\". SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z < -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia."}

These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\\text{RH} \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $γ$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders."}

They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties.

In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons)."}

We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $α$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars."}

By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies."}

By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits.

These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\\text{RH} \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $γ$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders."}

Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $φ^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $φ^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions."}

Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power.

In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT."}

In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n  Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and Müller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients.\n  These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments. These include the verification of the thermodynamic relations employed in the first formulation method using microscopic frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding of the emerging transport coefficients - particularly those associated with the spin tensor - through microscopic modeling or data-driven parameter extraction."}

By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations."}

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations."}

The system exhibits a duality governed by its Maxwell charge Q: for large Q it falls into the class W = 1, displaying van der Waals-type behavior with a first-order small-large black hole transition. For small Q, it shifts to W = 0, characteristic of a Hawking-Page transition. This topological classification provides a model-independent validation of the conventional thermodynamic analysis. Crucially, we find that the non-minimal coupling lambda stabilizes the Hawking-Page universality class W=0 for black holes with non-zero charge, a phenomenon absent in the standard Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS case. This establishes a direct link between the microscopic coupling and the macroscopic topological class, demonstrating the power of topological methods in decoding thermodynamic universality across modified gravity theories."}

In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT."}

Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime."}

Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $φ^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $φ^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions."}

We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge.

Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise."}

In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities.

Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power.

Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory."}

Such integrals appear in various contexts: tensor reduction of Feynman integrals, Fourier transform of Feynman integrals, and spin-resummed dynamics in post-Minkowskian gravity. First, we construct a mathematical framework that manifests the geometric interpretation of twisted Feynman integrals. Next, we generalise the standard mathematical tools for studying Feynman integrals for application to their twisted cousins, and explore their mathematical properties. In particular, it is found that (i) twisted Feynman integrals fall under the class of exponential periods, and (ii) the leading singularity approach using the (generalised) Baikov parametrisation applied to twisted Feynman integrals fail to detect the geometry underlying their function space."}

Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra."}

We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\\fracα{4}{\\cal G}$ ($\\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $α$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data."}

Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise."}

Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes."}

By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology."}

We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \\overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk \"Dirichlet deformation\" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \\overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms. We check our results by calculating the deformed energy spectrum for either case using both the bulk and boundary prescriptions, finding agreement after taking into account additional terms coming from the flow of the scalar source.
