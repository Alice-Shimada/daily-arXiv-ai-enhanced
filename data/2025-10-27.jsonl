For groups binned by total\nluminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\\rm gal}$ from\ngroup-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo\nmass $M_h$.

Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve\nthe Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance\nrather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our\nsimulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by\napproximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova\nfeedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through\nAGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling\npreserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy,\ncreating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism\noperates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate\nAGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy.\nCritically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert:\nwithout SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too\npowerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match\nobservations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar\nshock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed.

We used astrochemical kinetics models to\nexplore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction\nwith CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase\nchemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse\nthrough to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include\nNH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice\nproducts and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud,\nincluding sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low\ntemperatures (~10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of ~2x10^-10 nH. Its\nformation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal\nreaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface\nhydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of\n~8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance\npeak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core\nconditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity.\nMolecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species\nseem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated\ninterstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to\nmore complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule\ngas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked\nlower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and\nlifetimes."}

The goal of this paper is to\ncombine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess\nin which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic.

Our\nmain finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg\nmodel, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large\n$q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite\nfamily of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the\n$p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann\nalgebra.

While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and\ndynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped\ncold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo.\nUsing high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find\nthat CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds.\nSpecifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface\narea and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in\nmass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the\ncentral galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to\nthe no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass\nin the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in\nsimulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal\ngas.

For groups binned by total\nluminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\\rm gal}$ from\ngroup-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo\nmass $M_h$.

This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds --\nspaces endowed with a degenerate metric.

We first introduce the\nmodern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the\nmetric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries,\nand link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We\nshow the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and\nconstruct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection.

This novel approach\nlinks the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the\ncumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated,\nself-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to\nfour isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and\nLeo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we\nindependently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and\nmetallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements,\nfinding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our\nanalysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries.\nWe then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from\nthe TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus\nsemi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best\nreproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher\nmetallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar\nfeedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the\npredicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times.\nThis work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically\nmotivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and\nhighlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal\nretention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies."}

WimPyC is an extension of the\nWimPyDD code, that calculates WIMP-nucleus scattering signals in direct\ndetection (DD) experiments, and allows to combine DD and capture in celestial\nbodies in virtually any scenario within the framework of Galilean-invariant\nnon-relativistic effective theory (NREFT), including inelastic scattering, an\narbitrary WIMP spin and a generic WIMP velocity distribution in the Galactic\nhalo. WimPyDD and WimPyC are suitable for both top-down approaches, where the\ninteraction operators of a high-energy physics model are matched to those of\nthe NREFT, and to bottom-up studies, where the Wilson coefficients of the NREFT\nare explored in a model-independent way and/or where the velocity distribution\nis written in terms of a superposition of streams taken as free parameters. As\nin the case of WimPyDD WimPyC exploits the factorization of the three main\ncomponents that enter in the calculation of the capture rate: i) the Wilson\ncoefficients that encode the dependence of the signals on the ultraviolet\ncompletion of the effective theory; ii) a response function that depends on the\nnuclear physics; iii) the halo function that depends on the WIMP velocity\ndistribution. In WimPyC these three components are calculated and stored\nseparately for later interpolation and combined together only as the last step\nof the signal evaluation procedure. This makes the phenomenological study of\nthe capture rate with WimPyC transparent and improves computational speed."}

Compared to our previous work, the simulated\nimages in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational\nconditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat\ntrail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density\nacross different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail\nreconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric\nmeasurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to\ncorrect the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of\ncontamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction,\nincluding both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two\nmetrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats,\nand (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions.\nFollowing trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the\nfraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km\naltitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band.

We show that for any new physics model such that the\ncorrections to the non-Abelian couplings are equal (or nearly so), $M_X$ is\nequal (or close to) the partial unification scale $\\mu^{\\rm SM}_{32}$; the\nlatter scales could be disentangled only if the corrections to the non-Abelian\ncouplings are significantly different. We explore how the parametrization works\nfor some relevant models with new physics below $M_X$, as low energy\nsupersymmetry, split supersymmetry, etc. As for models with a desert up to\n$M_X$, we explore in particular how the parametrization works for string\ninspired corrections; we find a phenomenologically remarkable possibility for\nunification at about $100$ TeV, suggesting a low string scale, in addition to\nthe more conservative possibility for unification at $\\mu^{\\rm SM}_{32}$."}

The\ndevelopment of viable candidates for quantum gravity allows now to investigate\nthese ideas. Analytic methods show that the description of geons needs to be\nbased on composite operators made out of the graviton field. We present results\nfrom a numerical investigation into this idea using causal dynamical\ntriangulations, an ab-initio non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity\nbased on general relativity, and accessible in lattice-gauge-theory-like\nsimulations. Our results suggest an interesting dependence on cosmological time\nand other unexpected features. Finally, we extend the analytic part of the\nsetting to a supergravity scenario.

This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds --\nspaces endowed with a degenerate metric. We begin with an algebraic overview of\nthe Carroll group, its conformal extension, and its relation to the BMS group.\nThen, in the core of the review, we follow the standard pseudo-Riemannian\nnarrative: metric $\\to$ connection $\\to$ curvature. We first introduce the\nmodern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the\nmetric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries,\nand link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We\nshow the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and\nconstruct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection. A preferred\nconnection is then identified intrinsically and later shown to coincide with\nthe one induced by embedding a null hypersurface in an ambient spacetime. The\nthird part develops the associated curvature tensors. We include novel results\npresented here for the first time.\n  Two advanced topics highlight the broader scope of this framework. The first\ntreats null hypersurfaces via the rigging technique, deriving the induced\ngeometry from the ambient space. This provides a unified language for\nspacelike, timelike, and null hypersurfaces, and shows that the induced rigged\nconnection exactly reproduces the intrinsic Carrollian one. From this, the\nGauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations follow, and the Einstein equations emerge\nas conservation laws for the null Brown-York stress tensor. The second topic\nextends the Carrollian setup to generic, non-null hypersurfaces, enabling a\nsmooth null limit and completing the unified geometric description of\nhypersurfaces of all causal characters."}

Since $N^2/\\lambda$ is\nimaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap\nwith the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary\ninvestigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\\pm$\nsign of $N^2$ and $\\lambda$.\n  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real\ndimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is\nodd, allowing $N^2$ to be real.
