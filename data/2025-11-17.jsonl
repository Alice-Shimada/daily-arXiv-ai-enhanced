But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign\" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition\"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet.

The usual representation of the index involves a multi-dimensional contour integral over the BPS spectrum of the free gauge theory. To find a closed form expression for the index, it is natural to attempt a residue evaluation. However, the presence of a non-isolated essential singularity inside the contour prevents a straightforward implementation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by gauge-fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Macdonald index, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. The simplified form manifests the strongly coupled BPS spectrum of the Macdonald sector of the theory, and suggests the absence of ``non-graviton'' operators in this sector. We also evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral.

Proposed for acceptance in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Abstract shortened for publication in ArXiv", "summary": "While galaxy cluster masses are fundamental cosmological observables, estimates based on intra-cluster medium observations rely on hydrostatic equilibrium, introducing a systematic bias. We investigate how mergers drive the time evolution of this hydrostatic mass bias, identifying the dominant physical mechanisms and their dependence on dynamical state and merger history. Using a high-resolution AMR Eulerian+$N$-body cosmological simulation, we analyse a sample of cluster mergers within $1.5 \\leq z \\leq 0$, comparing true and hydrostatic masses derived from gas density and temperature profiles, and tracing their evolution. At $z=0$, the hydrostatic mass bias shows a mild correlation with dynamical state. During major mergers, the bias follows a characteristic trend: a sharp negative dip around the merger time, a transient positive peak, and a gradual return to pre-merger levels. This behaviour is primarily driven by morphological and dynamical reconfigurations of the gas density within the ICM, while thermodynamical processes play a secondary role. The pattern shows no strong dependence on secondary parameters, such as mass ratio or impact parameter, but it can be fitted to a simple time-dependent functional form. This trend is present at radii $r\\le R_{\\mathrm{vir}}$, although with reduced amplitude and shorter timescales as the radius decreases. Hydrostatic mass bias is closely linked, albeit in a non-trivial way, with the merging history of galaxy clusters. We find that the bias values are weakly correlated with the dynamical state of clusters. Nevertheless, our results give a robust estimation of the hydrostatic mass bias values in the pre-merger, merging, and post-merger phases. These findings highlight the importance of delving deeper into the observational assessment of cluster assembly state in order to improve mass estimations for cosmological analyses."}

The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation.

However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries."}

However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this \"outskirt mass\" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data."}

In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\\rm 200} \\sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \\; \\Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes.

Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement.

In particular, we describe how to compute the non-equilibrium two point function of the scalar field, showing explicitly the role of the initial state in regulating divergences. To do so, we use a \"mod-squared-retarded\" pole-prescription and find that the covariance in the field is non-zero only outside the lightcone, scales inversely with the spatial distance of the spacetime points and grows linearly in time. The energy has a contact divergence similar to that found in the quantum case. We conclude by discussing possible implications of anomalous diffusion for hybrid theories of gravity, especially looking at the energy density in the predicted gravitational waves background, which can be inferred from the scalar covariances."}

The presence of vacuum-like jets, jets that experienced little interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma, in the nucleus-nucleus samples dilutes the overall observed modification hindering the detailed study of the underlying physical mechanisms. The ability to ascertain on a jet-by-jet basis the degree of modification of a jet would be an invaluable step in overcoming this limitation. We consider a Transformer classifier, trained on a low-level representation of jets given by the 4-momenta of all its constituents. We show that the Transformer is able to capture discriminating information not accessible to other architectures which use high-level physical observables as input. The Transformer allows us to identify, in the experimentally relevant case where both medium response and underlying event contamination are accounted for, a class of jets that have been unequivocally modified. Further, we perform a robust estimate of the upper bound for the fraction of jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions that are, for all purposes, indistinguishable from those produced in proton-proton collisions."}

To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration.

To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission."}

We applied a weighted kernel density estimation method to 160,000 galaxies with robust photometric redshifts. We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z\\lesssim2.5$, while at higher redshifts ($2.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim5.5$) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$, reversing at $z\\gtrsim1.8$, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to $z\\sim5.5$. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at $z\\gtrsim2.5$, the two processes act with comparable strength between $0.8\\lesssim z\\lesssim2.5$, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies ($M_\\star\\lesssim10^{10} M_\\odot$) at $z\\lesssim0.8$. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history.

Using realistic simulations we investigate the impact of Galactic foreground residuals from multi-frequency foreground cleaning method on the lensing reconstruction, delensing CMB B-mode maps and constraints of the tensor-to-scalar ratio for CMB-S4-like experiment. We pay special attention to studies of the errors coming from small angular scale non-Gaussianity of the foreground residuals. We show that component separation is essential for the lensing reconstruction reducing Galactic emission contribution to the lensing reconstruction errors by one order of magnitude. The residual foreground contribution is dominated by terms coming from Gaussian components of the residual maps. Errors coming from non-Gaussian components are around three orders of magnitude smaller than the Gaussian one even for recent and the most complex models of the Galactic emission considered in this work. Although the bias in the reconstruction errors due to Gaussian component of the residuals is small, it is comparable to the cosmic variance limit for the lensing power spectrum. For this reason we correct for this bias in delensing of B-mode maps and constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We show also that for the delensed B-mode maps with a simple quadratic estimator, residuals of the Galactic emission after component separation, errors are two orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainties from leftover of the lensing signal. However, for high-sensitivity CMB experiments and more efficient delensing algorithms that remove up to 90% of the lensing signal, the foreground residuals will become one of the main sources of errors."}

Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA)."}

To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive ($9~<~\\log(M_{\\star}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot})~<~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program.

We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, H$α$, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between $50-80$ per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of $f=0.50\\pm0.08$, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians $25-120$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above $z=7$ literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift.

We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for $z\\simeq7$ galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the $100$ Myr average SFR by a factor of $\\simeq3$.

We constrain the slow-roll parameters directly by adopting the latest datasets, including Planck satellite data, BICEP2/Keck data and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. An advantage of this method is that we can work out the predictions of single-field slow-roll inflation model by using these constrained slow-roll parameters. We illustrate the predictions of the parameters characterizing the scalar power spectrum and constrain some inflation models. We find that the inflation model with monomial potential is disfavored, and the inflation models with a concave potential, such as the Starobinsky inflation model, brane inflation model are preferred.

Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\\sim100\\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\\geq 10^8 M_\\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies."}

The formula arises naturally from a three-dimensional topological field theory obtained by a twisted dimensional reduction of the 4d theory. Such a reduction often gives rise to a 3d ${\\mathcal N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theory that is expected to flow to an ${\\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal fixed point. After performing a topological twist, we obtain a 3d TFT admitting boundary conditions that support the vertex operator algebra associated with the original 4d theory. In this framework, the Macdonald index appears as a half-index of the 3d gauge theory, with the Macdonald grading determined by a distinguished $U(1)_A$ symmetry in the infrared ${\\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal algebra. We present a general procedure to identify this $U(1)_A$ symmetry and, whenever possible, show that it produces the known prescription for computing the Macdonald index from the refined character of the associated vertex operator algebra. Our construction also gives a hint towards the IR formula for the Macdonald index, from the 4d BPS particles on the Coulomb branch."}

Within this framework, we construct an isotropic and homogeneous metric analogous to the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric but without a universal speed limit. Two distinct solutions of the Einstein-like field equations are obtained: (i) a vacuum configuration ($λ=0$) yielding an exponential--quadratic scale factor, and (ii) a dust-dominated universe ($λ=1$) described by a non-interacting nonrelativistic fluid. Upon dimensional reduction to $3+1$ spacetime through a specific embedding, the model naturally develops anisotropy in the scale factor and density, consistent with the near-zero spatial curvature inferred from Planck data. In the case of vanishing spatial curvature, the framework reproduces Milne's Newtonian cosmology because this condition leads to a vanishing pressure. This provides an independent nonrelativistic setting for cosmological dynamics within Galilean covariance."}

We present in this paper an approach to enable the simulation of SSSB conditions in a drop tower facility on Earth, which is being addressed as part of the AKUS (\"Activity of Comets under Partial Gravity\") project. This especially concerns their prevailing gravity levels, which range between 10^-2 g and 10^-4 g. In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed."}

The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M > 24M_\\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios."}

We begin with confrontation of predictions from mutated hilltop inflation with the joint analysis of Planck-2018 and BICEP/Keck-2018 data. Subsequently, we extend our analysis by incorporating the ACT-DR6 data in combination with Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck-2018, and DESI-Y1 observations. In both cases, the predictions of mutated hilltop inflation show good consistency with the observational constraints. We have also forecasted the constraints on mutated hilltop inflation model from upcoming CMB experiments, LiteBIRD and Simons Observatory along with their combinations. Here also we find that the prediction from mutated hilltop inflation are in tune with those upcoming CMB experiments. The small-field sector of mutated hilltop inflation, in principle, can probe up to $r\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, resulting in a tensor amplitude consistent with current bounds and potentially detectable by next-generation CMB missions. However, accommodating the high observational value of the scalar spectral index may demand relatively higher e-foldings in mutated hilltop inflation. A key appealing feature of the mutated hilltop inflation model turns out to be its ability to remain consistent with a potential non-detection of primordial gravitational waves by LiteBIRD and/or Simons Observatory."}

Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \\sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \\ge 10^4 M_{\\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial \"structure\" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations.

We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\\,\\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\\star} \\approx 70\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\\star} > 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment.

We show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the exponential representation, the tubes can be constructed for arbitrary values of the flavor number, $N$, with the topological charge being proportional to this number. The flat limit of this solution, which corresponds to an array of baryonic tubes in a finite volume, is analyzed in detail.

The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will offer unprecedented insights into this era through observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal, enabling constraints on the Universe's reionization history. We investigate the information content of the average neutral hydrogen fraction ($\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}$) in several Gaussian (spherical and cylindrical power spectra) and non-Gaussian (Betti numbers and bispectrum) summary statistics of the 21-cm signal. Mock 21-cm observations are generated using the AA* configuration of SKAO's low-frequency telescope, incorporating noise levels for 100 and 1000 hours. We employ a state-of-the-art implicit inference framework to learn posterior distributions of $\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}$ in redshift bins centred at $z=8.0,7.2$ and $6.5$, for each statistic and noise scenario, validating the posteriors through calibration tests. Using the figure of merit to assess constraining power, we find that Betti numbers alone are on average more informative than the power spectra, while the bispectrum provides limited constraints. However, combining higher-order statistics with the cylindrical power spectrum improves the mean figure of merit by $\\sim$0.25 dex ($\\sim33\\%$ reduction in $σ(\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI})$).

For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \\textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable."}

Such decays are very important for the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ and testing the nature of the excited light mesons. The mixing schemes for the isoscalar light mesons are considered. The possible assignment of the experimentally observed excited light mesons to the particular states is discussed. The form factors parameterizing weak decay matrix elements between the initial $B$ meson and final light mesons are calculated with the complete account of the relativistic effects, including contributions of the intermediate negative energy states and relativistic transformations of the meson wave functions from rest to the moving reference frame. As a result the transferred momentum squared, $q^2$, dependence of the form factors is explicitly determined in the whole accessible kinematical range. On the basis of the helicity formalism the decay branching fractions and asymmetry and polarization parameters are calculated. The obtained results for the semileptonic $B$ decays to the ground states of light mesons are confronted with available experimental data. On this basis the value of the $|V_{ub}|$ matrix element is determined. It is found in good agreement with the value extracted from inclusive decays. Predictions for the branching fractions of the semileptonic $B$ decays to radially ($2S$ and $3S$) and orbitally ($1P$ and $2P$) excited light mesons are given. Comparison with the previous calculations is performed. It is found that several decays to the excited light mesons have branching fractions of the order $10^{-4}$ and, thus, they can be measured at existing and future $B$ factories."}

Analysing their luminosity-specific number density across galaxies of different morphologies has also shown hints that they may be used as tracers of the age and metallicity of stellar populations. A proper understanding of this relation has been hindered by the fact that simultaneously detecting PNe and accurately measuring stellar properties is extremely difficult using classical narrow-band imaging methods, which cannot detect PNe in the bright centres of galaxies. In this work, we use integral-field spectroscopy to overcome this challenge, analysing the inner regions of a sample of ten early-type galaxies from the Extended Planetary Nebulae Survey (ePN.S) for which archival MUSE data was available. With the Diffuse Emission-Line Filter (DELF) technique, we automate the detection of PNe, and perform spectral fitting on the diffuse light to infer kinematics and stellar population parameters. We compare the PN number density profile and its associated alpha-parameter with multiple properties of the host galaxies. We find that our sample follows the previously observationally constrained correlation with the metallicity of the host galaxy. We find a weak anti-correlation between the alpha-parameter and the FUV excess, highlighting the possible relation between the visibility lifetime of PNe on the spectral energy distribution of their host galaxies, with fewer PNe detected in association with stellar populations characterized by a UV excess."}

However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this \"outskirt mass\" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\\%$.

Existing analytic models often show large discrepancies with numerical relativity (NR) data, while data-driven models are limited to mass ratios of q<=8 (aligned spins) and q<=4 (precessing spins) and break down when extrapolated outside their training ranges. Using ~5000 of NR simulations from the SXS and RIT catalogs up to q=128 and ~100 black hole perturbation theory simulations up to q=200, we present two classes of models: (i) gwModel_kick_q200 (gwModel_kick_q200_GPR), an analytic (Gaussian process regression) model for aligned-spin binaries. (ii) gwModel_kick_prec_flow, a normalizing-flow model for kick distribution from precessing binaries with isotropic spins. Our approach combines analytic insights from post-Newtonian theory with data-driven techniques to ensure correct limiting behavior and high accuracy across parameter space. Both gwModel_kick_q200 and gwModel_kick_prec_flow are valid from comparable to extreme mass ratios. Extensive validation shows all three models outperform existing ones within their respective domains. Finally, using both back-of-the-envelope estimates and 1404 detailed star cluster simulations incorporating our kick models, we find that the black hole retention probability in low mass globular clusters can vary noticeably when the gwModel_kick_prec_flow model is employed.

This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \\cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $< 10\\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $λ<2\\ μ$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies."}

The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a \"dark photosphere\" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors."}

Abstract shortened for publication in ArXiv", "summary": "While galaxy cluster masses are fundamental cosmological observables, estimates based on intra-cluster medium observations rely on hydrostatic equilibrium, introducing a systematic bias. We investigate how mergers drive the time evolution of this hydrostatic mass bias, identifying the dominant physical mechanisms and their dependence on dynamical state and merger history. Using a high-resolution AMR Eulerian+$N$-body cosmological simulation, we analyse a sample of cluster mergers within $1.5 \\leq z \\leq 0$, comparing true and hydrostatic masses derived from gas density and temperature profiles, and tracing their evolution. At $z=0$, the hydrostatic mass bias shows a mild correlation with dynamical state. During major mergers, the bias follows a characteristic trend: a sharp negative dip around the merger time, a transient positive peak, and a gradual return to pre-merger levels. This behaviour is primarily driven by morphological and dynamical reconfigurations of the gas density within the ICM, while thermodynamical processes play a secondary role. The pattern shows no strong dependence on secondary parameters, such as mass ratio or impact parameter, but it can be fitted to a simple time-dependent functional form. This trend is present at radii $r\\le R_{\\mathrm{vir}}$, although with reduced amplitude and shorter timescales as the radius decreases. Hydrostatic mass bias is closely linked, albeit in a non-trivial way, with the merging history of galaxy clusters. We find that the bias values are weakly correlated with the dynamical state of clusters. Nevertheless, our results give a robust estimation of the hydrostatic mass bias values in the pre-merger, merging, and post-merger phases. These findings highlight the importance of delving deeper into the observational assessment of cluster assembly state in order to improve mass estimations for cosmological analyses."}

This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\\sim100\\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\\geq 10^8 M_\\odot$ in the energy-driven case.

But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign\" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition\"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model."}

The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a \"dark photosphere\" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors."}

We show that, using the maximal embedding Ansatz of $SU(2)$ into $SU(N)$ in the exponential representation, the tubes can be constructed for arbitrary values of the flavor number, $N$, with the topological charge being proportional to this number. The flat limit of this solution, which corresponds to an array of baryonic tubes in a finite volume, is analyzed in detail. Remarkably, although the energy of the solitons at a finite volume is an increasing function of $N$, the binding energy decreases as the number of flavors present in the theory increases, reaffirming that the inclusion of more than two flavors improves the predictions of the model."}

A generic prediction of the framework is the presence of a further light scalar state, the dilaton, which naturally couples weakly to the Higgs boson. The implementation of the framework usually requires the presence of a third, heavier state, which plays the role of dark matter and ensures the couplings run so that the multi-phase criticality condition is met. In this paper we consider the multi-phase criticality limit of an extension of the Standard Model including two extra scalar singlets, addressing the scenario with effective field theory methods that are particularly suited for treating the hierarchical mass spectrum that this construction yields. The analysis improves on the approximated results available in the Literature and explores the phenomenology of the model at collider and dark matter experiments. We find that the running of scalar couplings in the EFT between the two scales cannot be ignored, but the quantum corrections from the dark matter candidate are not noticeably modified."}

We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time.

We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\\star} \\approx 70\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\\star} > 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment.

We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \\cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $< 10\\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $λ<2\\ μ$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies."}

In both cases, the predictions of mutated hilltop inflation show good consistency with the observational constraints. We have also forecasted the constraints on mutated hilltop inflation model from upcoming CMB experiments, LiteBIRD and Simons Observatory along with their combinations.

The small-field sector of mutated hilltop inflation, in principle, can probe up to $r\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, resulting in a tensor amplitude consistent with current bounds and potentially detectable by next-generation CMB missions.

Finally, I use these results to re-express the fluxes of energy and angular momentum obtained at third post-Newtonian order in [arXiv:0711.0302] and [arXiv:0908.3854] in terms of fundamental frequencies."}

Our starting point is the Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue developed by the Euclid Consortium. For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \\textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable."}

Due to its significance as a signal process with considerable sensitivity to the top-quark mass and as a background process for new physics searches, it is crucial to predict differential cross sections with high precision. In this article, we present, for the first time, predictions for various kinematical observables at next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics. The perturbative behavior is analyzed, and uncertainties arising from missing higher-order contributions are substantially reduced. The necessary two-loop amplitudes have been evaluated in the leading-color approximation, and we provide estimates for the impact of the missing contributions."}

We investigate dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles, including spin-dependent interactions, for direct detection experiments and demonstrate that, although the scattering rate generally depends on multiple types of material response functions, certain linear combinations of these material response functions vanish if the initial and final electronic states share the same Hamiltonian. We also find that several other response functions vanish in parity-symmetric materials, making these systems as simple as isotropic detectors in some respects. Finally, we present the scattering rate for an anisotropic, possibly chiral detector, for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions. These relations reduce the number of independent response functions needed, thereby simplifying the computational complexity for a broad class of dark matter models. Our results provide a complete and efficient toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals in diverse detector materials."}

It has recently been demonstrated that this process is incompatible with a collinear factorization approach in terms of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at the leading twist. In such a situation, a (generalized) $k_T$-dependent factorization at small $x$ is a valid alternative approach. We perform this calculation using the shockwave formalism, which resums multiple gluon exchanges between the projectile and the dense nuclear target. We find that the polarized amplitude changes sign as a function of back-to-back transverse momentum $|\\vec{p}_t|$ of the pion-photon pair, resulting in a dip-like structure in the fully differential cross section as a function of $|\\vec{p}_t|$."}

In the first three sections we review the meson physics phenomenology, highlighting the history of the pseudoscalar multiplet mass spectra research. Then we propose a new approach for the mass mixing problem exclusively based on a second order phase transition principle. This development leads to new relations among the masses of the mesons in this nonet, which present a nice agreement with measurements. Also the quark constitutions and the mixing angle problem are correctly addressed. Then, after describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking process coming from this phenomenological analysis, we establish a field theory with the necessary elements that could reproduce theoretically such results. This is done in the second part of this work. In the end, our quantum analysis of this field theory shows a compatibility with the phenomenology, which allows for further exploration along this path."}

However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\\rm 200} \\sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \\; \\Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\\sigmam = 1 \\cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions."}

The relation between one-loop numerators and forward-limit tree numerators is clarified, together with the additional physical conditions required for a consistent double-copy interpretation.\n  We propose a two-step expansion strategy for obtaining explicit one-loop numerators. The Yang-Mills integrand is first decomposed into scalar-loop Yang-Mills-scalar building blocks, which are then expanded into bi-adjoint scalar integrands. We derive explicit results for up to three external gluons, showing how the kinematic consistency conditions uniquely determine the coefficients in each case.

We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity.

Focusing on the tower of multi-H diagrams that govern the leading logarithmic behavior, we compute the leading double logarithm at four loops (5PM) using both effective field theory methods and the multi-Regge expansion, finding complete agreement.

But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign\" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition\"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model."}
