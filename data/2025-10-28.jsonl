In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the\nIllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the\ndark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find\nthat the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent\nnon-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed\ndistribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity.

We present a joint UV and optical abundance analysis using a new\nsuite of $\\texttt{Cloudy}$ photoionization models covering a wide density range\n($n_e=10^2-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a\nsample of star-forming galaxies across $0.0\\lesssim z \\lesssim10.6$. We find\nthat assuming uniform, low-density conditions ($n_e\\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) in\nhigh-density environments ($n_e\\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) can bias nebular\ndiagnostics by overestimating $T_e$ (up to 1800 K), overpredicting $\\log U$ (by\n$>1$ dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly\ninflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-$z$ require a\nmulti-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O\nabundances for our sample and present the first $\\log U$ diagnostics and ICFs\nfor high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically\noverestimate N/O by $\\sim0.3-0.4$ dex relative to the optical benchmark. We\nfind that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both $n_e$ and star\nformation rate surface density ($\\rm\\Sigma_{SFR}$), suggesting that N/O is\ntemporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the $n_e$\nevolution with $z$ is more gradual than the $(1+z)^3$ scaling of virial halo\ndensities, suggesting that $n_e$evolution is shaped by both cosmological\nstructure growth and baryonic processes. These trends point to prompt N/O\nenrichment potentially driven by very massive stars, with key implications for\ninterpreting UV emission and determining reliable chemical abundances from JWST\nobservations of the early universe."}

The work\ntraces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that\nproduced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the\nthermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet\nluminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies.

The\nsecond part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary\nstars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active\ngalactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen\nreionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer\nsimulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how\nthe timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and\nHe II Ly-alpha observations.

The HST data are supplemented by SDSS spectra of all galaxies\nand by a VLT/Xshooter spectrum of one galaxy, J0232+0025. These data are used\nto derive the spectral energy distribution in the entire UV and optical range,\nthe stellar mass, and the chemical composition from the nebular emission lines.\nWe detect stellar LyC emission in seven out of eleven galaxies with escape\nfractions, f_esc(LyC), in the range of ~ 2 - 60%, and establish upper limits\nfor f_esc(LyC) in the remaining galaxies. We discover for the first time\nnebular LyC emission as a bump just bluewards of the LyC limit at 912A in two\ngalaxies, J0232+0025 and J1021+0436.

Using Bayesian model selection, we infer posteriors for the GWB\namplitude and spectral slope and compute marginal likelihoods for each\nscenario. We confirm a common-spectrum process with Hellings-Downs spatial\ncorrelations and recover a characteristic strain amplitude at f_yr = 1/year of\nA_GWB approx 2.4e-15, with a slope consistent with gamma approx 13/3 as\nexpected for supermassive black hole binaries. While fully consistent with an\nastrophysical origin, cosmological sources are not excluded: cosmic strings\nwith Gmu ~ 1e-11 to 1e-10 and phase transitions peaking near 1e-8 to 1e-7 Hz\ncan reproduce the observed amplitude within allowed parameter ranges. Current\nBayes factors do not show a decisive preference among these scenarios. We\ndiscuss noise-mitigation implications and prospects for discrimination with\nfuture PTA observations."}

Our analysis reveals a\nstatistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting\nlines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\\sim$7\\% excess of\nalignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random\ndistribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong\ndependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc\nfrom the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc\ndisplay no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal\ndistribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct\ndynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction\nprocesses. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical\nmodels in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web\ndrive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a\nrepresentative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group\nassembly.

We investigate whether the elongation of\ngalaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments,\nproviding the first observational test of this relationship in large\nsupercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two\ndimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift\nsub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the\nShapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the\nalignment between filament directions --traced by galaxy distributions- and the\ntriaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials --traced by X-ray emission-\nusing publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%)\nof the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically\ndetected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the\nelongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing\nobservational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment\nprogressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6 r_{200}$).\nOverall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of\ngalaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that\nmatter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy\nclusters.

In order to address this issue, we\nconsider the background geometry which breaks the isometry spontaneously. Then\nthe local gauge invariant operator can be constructed through the St\\\"uckelberg\nmechanism, where the fluctuation of the metric in the direction of the isometry\nbreaking combines with that of matter whose classical solution breaks the\nisometry. This is equivalent to introducing the clock and the rod to promote\nthe local field operators to the gauge invariant ones. A typical example is the\ncurvature perturbation in quasi-de Sitter space arising from the spontaneous\nbreaking of the timelike isometry. We also discuss the features of the local\ngauge invariant operator when the spacelike isometry is spontaneously broken.\nMeanwhile, even if the local gauge invariant operators exist, it does not\nguarantee the reliable construction of the gauge invariant operators on the\nlocal region like the island, which is regarded as an essential ingredient to\nresolve the black hole information paradox. This is because the fluctuation of\nthe spacetime point is accumulated in time, which in fact also gives rise to\neternal inflation in quasi-de Sitter space. In order to suppress the\nfluctuation at late time, the isometry must be strongly broken by the\nbackground.

The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of\nsuch a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the\ninstrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum\nsignal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode\ngain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a\nthree-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data,\nseparating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to\nthe COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable\nresonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain\ndegeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of\nJupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show\nthat the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum\nsource, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two\napplications to COMAP. For the COMAP observations performing line intensity\nmapping (LIM), the technique better suppresses atmospheric fluctuations and\nforegrounds than the COMAP LIM pipeline. For the Galactic COMAP observations,\nwhich map Galactic continuum signals, the technique can suppress $1/f$ gain\nfluctuations while retaining all continuum signals.

Using adaptive kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift\nand luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results\nreveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE).\nMotivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure\nluminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full\nmaximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and\nconstraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts\n(SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly\nfavors LADE over PLE.

Both LADE models\nreproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges,\nwhereas PLE underperforms.

At these\nredshifts, machine learning-based selection methods have proven to be\nefficient, but require appropriate training sets to express their full\npotential. Here, we present QUEST, a Variational Auto-Encoder capable of\ngenerating realistic quasar spectra that can be post-processed for generating\nsynthetic photometry and for spectral imputation. We start from the SDSS DR16Q\ncatalogue, pre-process the spectra, and vet the sample to obtain a clean data\nset. After training the model, we investigate the properties of its latent\nspace to understand whether it has learnt relevant physics. We provide a\npipeline to generate photometry from the sampled spectra, compare it with\nactual quasar photometry, and showcase the capabilities of the model in\nreconstructing and extending quasar spectra. The trained network faithfully\nreproduces the input spectrum, both in terms of sample median and variance. By\nexamining the latent space, we find correlations with continuum and bolometric\nluminosity, BH mass, redshift, continuum slope, and emission line properties.\nWhen used to generate photometry, we find results in excellent agreement with\nthe control sample. The model provides satisfactory results in reconstructing\nemission lines: estimates of the BH mass from the reconstructed spectra are in\ngood agreement with those from the original spectra. Furthermore, when spectra\nwith broad absorption line features are reconstructed, the model successfully\ninterpolates over the absorption systems. Compared with previous work, we find\nexcellent agreement between the spectra sampled from our model and the output\nof their results. However, QUEST does not require any ad-hoc tuning, and is\ncapable of reproducing the full variety of spectra available in the training\nset."}

Using integral field spectroscopy from\nSDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk\ngalaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star\nformation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology\nusing harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global\nkinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the\nfirst-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find\nthat galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from\nthe scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation\nmain sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In\ncontrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase\nmetallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star\nformation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation\ngenerally exhibit higher HI gas fractions.

With\nour current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to\nconfidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely,\nthe stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the\npotential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are\nable to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key\ngoal of COMAP)."}

Depending on the inner radius of the disk,\nthe thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap.\nTo characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging -- the\nvalue of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders\nbegin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices\ncorresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii\nin the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand\ncorner is filled. The matrix is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known,\nit provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any\nchosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging\nexhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric\nmetrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light\ntrajectories.

At these\nredshifts, machine learning-based selection methods have proven to be\nefficient, but require appropriate training sets to express their full\npotential. Here, we present QUEST, a Variational Auto-Encoder capable of\ngenerating realistic quasar spectra that can be post-processed for generating\nsynthetic photometry and for spectral imputation. We start from the SDSS DR16Q\ncatalogue, pre-process the spectra, and vet the sample to obtain a clean data\nset. After training the model, we investigate the properties of its latent\nspace to understand whether it has learnt relevant physics. We provide a\npipeline to generate photometry from the sampled spectra, compare it with\nactual quasar photometry, and showcase the capabilities of the model in\nreconstructing and extending quasar spectra. The trained network faithfully\nreproduces the input spectrum, both in terms of sample median and variance. By\nexamining the latent space, we find correlations with continuum and bolometric\nluminosity, BH mass, redshift, continuum slope, and emission line properties.\nWhen used to generate photometry, we find results in excellent agreement with\nthe control sample. The model provides satisfactory results in reconstructing\nemission lines: estimates of the BH mass from the reconstructed spectra are in\ngood agreement with those from the original spectra. Furthermore, when spectra\nwith broad absorption line features are reconstructed, the model successfully\ninterpolates over the absorption systems. Compared with previous work, we find\nexcellent agreement between the spectra sampled from our model and the output\nof their results. However, QUEST does not require any ad-hoc tuning, and is\ncapable of reproducing the full variety of spectra available in the training\nset."}

However, higher-order statistics, such\nas the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer\nadditional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and\npower spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To\naddress this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the\nbispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level\nbispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field\ntheory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on\nsynthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the\ntransmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the\nbispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian\nsmoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the\nstatistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum\nprediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the\ncosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use\na line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew\nspectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally\napplying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field\nin the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and\nline-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory\nprediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced)\nfield with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function\nmaking this approach readily applicable to DESI data."}

First, we investigate SCPV\nin the exact SUSY limit, extending the spurion formalism developed in\nnon-supersymmetric theories and introducing a method to determine whether the\ngiven superpotential satisfies the necessary condition for SCPV.

We undertook a radio survey for bow shocks based on IR\ncatalogues of candidates, using the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope,\naiming for new detections and to better characterise the multi-wavelength\nemission. We used Gaia DR3 to re-calculate spatial motion of the driving stars\nwith respect to the surrounding stellar population. We studied the radio\nemission from bow shocks using emission maps and spectral-index measurements,\nand compared our results with data from catalogues and multi-wavelength\nemission. Of the 24 targets observed with the VLA in the 4-12 GHz band, six\nwere clearly detected (including two previously reported) and 5 possibly\ndetected. A subset of these were also observed and detected with Effelsberg at\n4-8 GHz. The VLA-derived spectral index maps indicate non-thermal emission for\nmost sources, but the statistical uncertainties are large for most sources and\nall Effelsberg observations indicate thermal emission. Assuming thermal\nemission, we obtain upper limits on the electron density within the shocked\nlayer. We obtained upper limits on radio emission from the bow shock of Zeta\nOph at a similar flux level to predictions from MHD simulations.

We investigate whether the elongation of\ngalaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments,\nproviding the first observational test of this relationship in large\nsupercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two\ndimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift\nsub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the\nShapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the\nalignment between filament directions --traced by galaxy distributions- and the\ntriaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials --traced by X-ray emission-\nusing publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%)\nof the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically\ndetected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the\nelongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing\nobservational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment\nprogressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6 r_{200}$).\nOverall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of\ngalaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that\nmatter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy\nclusters.

However, higher-order statistics, such\nas the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer\nadditional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and\npower spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To\naddress this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the\nbispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level\nbispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field\ntheory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on\nsynthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the\ntransmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the\nbispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian\nsmoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the\nstatistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum\nprediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the\ncosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use\na line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew\nspectra.

We also discuss the features of the local\ngauge invariant operator when the spacelike isometry is spontaneously broken.\nMeanwhile, even if the local gauge invariant operators exist, it does not\nguarantee the reliable construction of the gauge invariant operators on the\nlocal region like the island, which is regarded as an essential ingredient to\nresolve the black hole information paradox. This is because the fluctuation of\nthe spacetime point is accumulated in time, which in fact also gives rise to\neternal inflation in quasi-de Sitter space. In order to suppress the\nfluctuation at late time, the isometry must be strongly broken by the\nbackground. In the case of the evaporating black hole, it may be achieved by\nthe transition to the higher dimensional black hole."}

In this\nstudy, we extend this topological analysis to higher-dimensional, static,\nspherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black holes. By examining the\nasymptotic properties of the vector field associated with the photon spheres,\nwe demonstrate that their topological charge is consistently -1. This result is\na dimensionally independent invariant, guaranteeing the existence of at least\none standard (unstable) photon sphere outside the event horizon. We further\nexplore this conclusion by analyzing two distinct regular black hole solutions\nderived from pure gravity theory, confirming that the topological charge\nremains -1 irrespective of the spacetime dimension. These results provide a\nrobust and universal characterization of photon spheres in higher-dimensional\nspacetimes."}

We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density\nfluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the\nOTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice.

Sullivan", "Patrick McDonald"], "title": "The Compressed 3D Lyman-Alpha Forest Bispectrum", "comment": "36 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Submitted to Phys. Rev. D. Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain\nparameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such\nas the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer\nadditional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and\npower spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To\naddress this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the\nbispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level\nbispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field\ntheory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on\nsynthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the\ntransmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the\nbispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian\nsmoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the\nstatistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum\nprediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the\ncosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use\na line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew\nspectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally\napplying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field\nin the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and\nline-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory\nprediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced)\nfield with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function\nmaking this approach readily applicable to DESI data."}
