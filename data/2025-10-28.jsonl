Verrier"], "title": "Magnetic clumping of charged dust in the dense interstellar medium", "comment": "Accepted in A&A. 19 pages, 19 figures", "summary": "Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments,\nespecially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is\ngenerally assumed to represent $1 \\%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations\nare expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading\nto enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to\ninvestigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense\nregions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes\nbeyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\\ttfamily shark} to perform\nmultifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas\nwith large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results:\nWe identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently\nforms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong\nclumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high\nlevels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects\nin regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high\ntransverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse\nMach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust\nexperiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable\nconditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal\nMHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to\nsmall-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability -\nlike mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density\nenhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure\nhydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in\nprotostellar envelopes a plausible scenario."}
