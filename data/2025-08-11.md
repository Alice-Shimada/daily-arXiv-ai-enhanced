### [1] [Universal sectors of two-dimensional Carrollian CFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05735)
*Ankit Aggarwal,Arjun Bagchi,Stephane Detournay,Daniel Grumiller,Max Riegler,Joan Simon*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores modular invariance in Carrollian CFTs, revealing subsectors with vacuum dominance and negative specific heat, akin to holographic properties of flat spacetime with horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the modular properties of Carrollian CFTs and their implications, especially in relation to flat space holography and gravitational phenomena like negative specific heat.

Method: The paper analyzes modular invariance in two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories geometrically, focusing on the characters of induced and highest-weight representations to identify vacuum dominance in the dual channel.

Result: The study identifies regions in parameter space where the vacuum character dominates in the dual channel, leading to the discovery of a Schwarzian-like subsector with a holographic O-plane orbifold interpretation and negative specific heat.

Conclusion: The study concludes that in Carrollian conformal field theories, certain subsectors, like the Schwarzian-like sector, exhibit properties such as negative specific heat, aligning with holographic interpretations of flat spacetime with horizons.

Abstract: We revisit modular invariance in two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field
theories from a geometric perspective. Focusing on the characters of the
induced and highest-weight representations of the theory, we show that there
are regions of parameter space where the vacuum character dominates in the dual
channel. We use this property to zoom into different subsectors of the
Carrollian theory. One of them is reminiscent of the Schwarzian sector of a
relativistic CFT2 and has a flat space holographic interpretation as O-plane
orbifold. It exists only for the highest-weight representation. We prove that
for all sectors with vacuum dominance in the dual channel, the specific heat is
negative, concurrent with the holographic interpretation of the negative
specific heat of asymptotically flat spacetimes with horizons.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种基于机器学习的全息体几何重构方法，适用于非渐近AdS时空，为描绘现实世界中非共形边界系统的新型体对偶几何提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that
works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of
boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively
adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green
functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian
renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve
space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE,
which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics.
Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we
demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS,
Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the
algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the
conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled
temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical
curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite
cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from
which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work
provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk
geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种独特的量子方法来探测低频引力波，不同于基于时空应变的传统检测策略。

Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating
from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum
geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent
subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical
or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak
waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive
phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical
description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric
protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become
entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of
the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly
quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering
an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.

### [4] [$AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude with KK modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06039)
*Hongliang Jiang,De-liang Zhong*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper calculates the first curvature correction to a specific string amplitude in $AdS_3 	imes S^3 	imes M_4$, providing results for operator data in the dual D1--D5 CFT at strong coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the first curvature correction to the string amplitude of four Kaluza--Klein modes in a specific string theory setup, which is dual to a four-point correlator in the boundary D1--D5 CFT.

Method: The study uses a two-step approach: deriving the $AdS_3 	imes S^3$ Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude using CFT block expansion and an ansatz based on single-valued multiple polylogarithms, and then generalizing the result using the $AdS 	imes S$ Mellin formalism.

Result: The result is an integral over the Riemann sphere with insertions of single-valued multiple polylogarithms of weight three, analogous to the flat-space Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights into the operator anomalous dimensions and OPE data in D1--D5 CFT at strong coupling, showing consistency with classical string theory computations.

Abstract: We study the first curvature correction to the string amplitude of four
Kaluza--Klein (KK) modes on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M_4$, with $M_4=K3$ or
$T^4$, in type IIB string theory, which is holographically dual to the
four--point correlator $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p_1} \mathcal{O}_{p_2}
\mathcal{O}_{p_3} \mathcal{O}_{p_4} \rangle$ of certain half--BPS operators in
the boundary D1--D5 CFT. The result takes the form of an integral over the
Riemann sphere, analogous to the flat-space Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude, but
with insertions of single-valued multiple polylogarithms of weight three. Our
results are obtained in two steps. First, we derive the $AdS_3 \times S^3$
Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude in the special case $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p}
\mathcal{O}_{p} \mathcal{O}_{1} \mathcal{O}_{1} \rangle$, by matching the CFT
block expansion with an ansatz based on single-valued multiple polylogarithms.
We then employ the $AdS \times S$ Mellin formalism to generalize the result to
the general case of four arbitrary KK modes $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p_1}
\mathcal{O}_{p_2} \mathcal{O}_{p_3} \mathcal{O}_{p_4} \rangle$. Our analysis
yields an infinite set of results for operator anomalous dimensions and OPE
data in D1--D5 CFT at strong coupling. In particular, the resulting scaling
dimensions of certain operators are shown to be consistent with classical
string theory computations.

### [5] [Continuous spin field in the $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06140)

TL;DR: 研究了在AdS6中连续自旋场的so(2,5)代数表示，利用Lie-Lorentz导数推导了Casimir算子的显式表达式，并通过算子约束确定了代数的所有Casimir算子的本征值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高维反德西特空间中连续自旋场的代数表示及其几何与自旋自由度的自然结合。

Method: 使用Lie-Lorentz导数实现so(2,5)代数，推导Casimir算子表达式，并通过算子约束进行分析。

Result: 得到了Casimir算子的显式形式，并发现其本征值由参数μ和正(半)整数s决定。

Conclusion: 成功构建了AdS6中连续自旋场的so(2,5)代数表示，并通过约束条件完全确定了Casimir算子的本征值。

Abstract: A representation of the $\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra corresponding to the
continuous spin field in $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ is considered. The algebra is
realized using the Lie-Lorentz derivative, which naturally incorporates
$\mathbf{AdS_6}$ geometry and spin degrees of freedom. Within this framework,
we derive explicit expressions for the Casimir operators in terms of both the
covariant derivative and the spin invariants. The continuous spin
representation under consideration is defined by a system of operator
constraints that generalize those known for six-dimensional Minkowski space. We
demonstrate that these constraints completely fix all Casimir operators of the
$\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra, with the eigenvalues determined by a dimensional
real parameter $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and a positive (half-)integer $s$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展之前对质量自旋5/2的研究，继续探索高自旋质量粒子的引力相互作用，包括其无质量和部分无质量的极限。

Method: 使用规范不变的框架形式来构建最小引力相互作用，包括标准最小相互作用和非最小相互作用。

Result: 发现了一个特殊点m²=6Λ，在dS₄中对应于允许的单位区域的边界，在这里最小相互作用消失，只留下非最小相互作用。

Conclusion: 该论文得出在特定点m²=6Λ时，自旋3粒子的最小引力相互作用消失，只留下非最小相互作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of gravitational interactions
for massive higher spins, extending our recent work on massive spin 5/2 to
massive spin 3, including its massless and partially massless limits. To
construct the minimal gravitational interactions (i.e. vertexes containing both
standard minimal interactions and non-minimal ones, which are necessary for any
$s \ge 5/2$), we use a gauge invariant frame-like formalism. Similarly to the
spin 5/2 case, there is a special point $m^2 = 6\Lambda$, which corresponds to
a boundary of the unitary allowed region in $dS_4$, where minimal interactions
disappear, leaving only the non-minimal ones.

### [7] [Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366)
*Syo Kamata*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 本文研究了PT对称和厄米特量子系统的谱性质，通过ODE/IM对应方法，基于T系统的融合关系推导出精确和规则和ζ生成公式，揭示了隐藏的代数结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PT对称和厄米特量子力学系统的全局谱数据背后的隐藏代数结构，利用T系统的融合关系建立频谱分析的新方法。

Method: 利用ODE/IM对应方法，将积分模型（IM）中的融合关系转化为常微分方程（ODE）侧的量化条件递推关系，并通过谱ζ函数（SZFs）重新表述这些关系，从而推导出ESRs和ZGFs。

Result: 提出了基于融合标签n的谱ζ函数（SZFs）的精确和规则（ESRs）和ζ生成公式（ZGFs），并揭示了由Chebyshev多项式结构和Z_{2M+2} Symanzik旋转对称性诱导的选择规则。

Conclusion: 本文通过ODE/IM对应框架，基于A_{2M-1} T系统的融合关系，推导出PT对称和厄米特量子力学系统的精确和规则（ESRs）和ζ生成公式（ZGFs），揭示了积分模型中T系统的频谱解释及隐藏的代数结构。

Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for
quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal
PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well
as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} +
1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework
of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the
integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among
quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which
we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) =
\sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the
fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while
the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different
fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on
both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the
Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the
$\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel
spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward
hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.

### [8] [Geometry of supergravity and the Batalin--Vilkovisky formulation of the $\mathcal N=1$ theory in ten dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06398)
*Julian Kupka,Charles Strickland-Constable,Fridrich Valach*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient BV formulation of ten-dimensional N=1 supergravity using generalized geometry, avoiding traditional Lorentz symmetry complications while fully satisfying the classical master equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a BV formulation of N=1 supergravity in ten dimensions that avoids introducing orthonormal frames and local Lorentz symmetries, simplifying the description and calculation.

Method: The authors use a generalized geometry approach to describe the field space as a fibred structure, where fermionic degrees of freedom span the fibres, and they analyze variations of spinorial quantities and the metric together.

Result: The result is a complete BV formulation of the theory that accounts for Lorentz transformation terms through geometric considerations, enabling a full and efficient verification of the classical master equation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their BV formulation of N=1 supergravity in ten dimensions, based on generalized geometry, efficiently satisfies the classical master equation without involving Lorentz degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We provide full details of a BV formulation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in
ten dimensions, to all orders in fermions, built from the generalised geometry
description of the theory. In contrast to standard treatments, we introduce
neither the degrees of freedom corresponding to orthonormal frames for the
metric nor the local Lorentz symmetries that remove them again. Instead, we
observe that the field space has a fibred structure, with the fermionic degrees
of freedom spanning the fibres. We explain in detail how this geometric picture
allows one to understand simultaneous variations of spinorial quantities and
the metric with respect to which the spinor bundles are defined. This leads to
additional terms in certain commutators on field space which account for the
Lorentz transformation terms appearing in the calculation of the supersymmetry
algebra. Unencumbered by the Lorentz degrees of freedom, we provide an
efficient and full demonstration that our action satisfies the classical master
equation.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对非极小算符热核问题的系统性计算方法，并通过特定减法程序实现了展开系数的有限性，为研究因果理论中的热核提供了新工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决非极小算符在热核计算中的复杂性和挑战，特别是针对具有非退化主符号的因果理论中的问题，需要发展一种系统性的计算形式主义。

Method: 基于伪微分算子理论，建立了一个从极小算符的热核到非极小算符的线性算符映射，并通过时空曲率、维度背景场及其协变导数的局部展开来实现。

Result: 开发了一种新的计算方法，能够系统地计算非极小算符的热核，并通过减法程序确保展开系数的有限性，且讨论了非极小算符热核的光滑性质。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种系统性的计算方法，用于处理因果理论中协变非极小算符的热核问题，并通过特定减法程序实现了有限函数的计算。

Abstract: We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant
nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null
with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a
pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear
operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal
one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime
curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with
the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its
derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time
integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important
part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples
of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate
principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of
nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their
operator symbols.

### [10] [Vacuum polarization in the horizonless Bardeen metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06465)

TL;DR: 本文研究了无质量量子标量场在Bardeen时空中的重整化应力-能量张量，发现共形与非共形耦合场在短距离和中等距离上的真空涨落差异显著，远距离恢复渐近行为，同时在强场区域可能出现不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子场论在无视界引力背景下的行为，特别是共形耦合与非共形耦合对真空涨落的影响，并检验共形反常有效作用在计算中的有效性。

Method: 使用弱场近似方法计算无质量量子标量场在Bardeen时空中的重整化应力-能量张量，并分析场在不同距离尺度上的行为以及共形反常有效作用的适用性。

Result: 在弱场近似下，共形耦合与非共形耦合场在短距离和中等距离的真空涨落存在显著差异；在远距离恢复了普遍的渐近行为。在强场区域，某些参数范围内场的模式产生虚频率，导致不稳定性和指数增长的真空涨落。

Conclusion: 研究显示，在无视界Bardeen时空背景下，共形耦合与非共形耦合场的真空涨落在短距离和中等距离上的表现有显著差异，而在远距离上恢复了普遍的渐近行为。此外，在强场区域某些参数范围内，场的模式可能产生虚频率，从而导致不稳定性和真空涨落的指数增长。

Abstract: We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum
scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the
weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ
significantly between conformally and non-conformally coupled fields, both in
magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large
distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in
black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime,
we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop
imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of
vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the
anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy
tensor in the conformally coupled case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前和即将进行的宇宙学调查将产生前所未有的高维数据，需要复杂的高保真前向模拟来准确建模物理过程和系统效应，同时验证理论模型是否准确描述观测数据仍是一个基本挑战。

Method: 利用尺度相关的神经网络模型对数据进行压缩和证据估计，并将其应用于具有不同子网格物理实现的CAMELS模拟套件。

Result: 通过条件化数据压缩和证据估计的神经网络模型，系统地以数据驱动的方式识别理论模型在何处失效。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合尺度相关神经摘要统计量与标准化流的新框架，用于通过贝叶斯证据估计检测宇宙学模拟中的模型误设。

Abstract: Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts
of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward
simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects
which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our
theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a
fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from
choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant
cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original
dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent
neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model
misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence
estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and
evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where
theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first
application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three
CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.

### [12] [Can dynamic dark energy explain the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, or strong baryon feedback?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05746)
*S. Heydenreich,A. Leauthaud,J. DeRose*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 动态暗能量模型有助于解释部分宇宙学异常，并对低红移宇宙膨胀有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决S_8张力、'透镜效应偏低'和强重子反馈等宇宙学异常问题，并探索动态暗能量在低红移宇宙膨胀中的作用。

Method: 通过分析ΛCDM和动态暗能量模型下星系-星系引力透镜信号、宇宙剪切和热苏尼亚耶夫-泽尔多维奇信号的差异，研究动态暗能量对三种宇宙学异常的影响。

Result: 动态暗能量使星系-星系透镜信号减少7%，宇宙剪切抑制14%，热苏尼亚耶夫-泽尔多维奇信号增加约15%，但不足以显著减少重子效应。

Conclusion: 动态暗能量可能有助于解释三个宇宙学异常中的两个，并且对z≲0.5的宇宙膨胀有重要影响，而弱引力透镜测量是限制低红移下与Λ模型偏差的有前途的方法。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a DESI motivated dynamic dark energy cosmology
on three cosmological anomalies, the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low'
effect, and observations of strong baryonic feedback. We analyze how these
observations vary in $\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy
clustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are
primarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the
lensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy
increases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is
insufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus,
we find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three
cosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on
cosmic expansion at $z\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic
oscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to
distances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a
promising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\Lambda$ at low
redshifts.

*Daniel Morales Hernández,Gabriela Garcia-Arroyo,J. Alberto Vazquez*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文探讨了粒子群优化（PSO）算法在宇宙学数据分析中的应用，特别是在暗能量模型探索和观测数据（如DESI和Union3）处理中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于宇宙学实验数据的大量涌现，需要高效的分析方法，因此本文提出将粒子群优化（PSO）算法作为传统宇宙学数据分析方法的补充。

Method: 实现了两种经典PSO算法（全局最佳和局部最佳）来探索暗能量模型，并基于Ia型超新星和重子声学振荡观测数据（特别是DESI和DESI+Union3数据集）进行分析。

Result: 结果表明PSO算法能够有效地从观测数据中找到最佳拟合参数，并在某些条件下提供与MCMC方法相当的结果，但所需时间更短。

Conclusion: PSO算法在宇宙学数据分析中具有竞争力，并能在较短时间内给出结果，同时其输出可作为MCMC方法的输入以加速分析。

Abstract: The search for the model or ingredients that describe the current vision of
our cosmos has led to the creation of a set of highly favorable experiments,
and therefore a great flow of information. Due to this torrent of information
and the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to
introduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional
cosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative
Bio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or
complex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during
the implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical
PSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the
light of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in
particular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the
performance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from
observational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver
competitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods.
Finally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods
to speed up its analysis.

Abstract: Context. The advent of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will increase the
collecting area by more than an order of magnitude compared to the individual
Unit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Fainter spectrophotometric
standard stars than those currently available in the V = 11 to 13 mag (K = 12
to 14 mag) range are required for spectroscopic observations with instruments
such as the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) on the ELT,
notably in the near-infrared wavelength regime. Aims. We identify suitable
spectrophotometric standard stars among white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres
(DA white dwarfs) in the magnitude range K =14 to 16 mag and provide reference
data based on stellar model atmospheres. Methods. We observed 24 candidate DA
white dwarfs with the X-shooter instrument on the VLT, covering the wavelength
range 300 nm to 2480 nm in three arms. We took care to include stars at
latitudes below and above -25 degrees to allow observations for all wind
directions at the location of the ELT. The spectra were analysed using model
fluxes from 3D pure-hydrogen local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres
and multi-band photometry. From the sample of observed targets, we selected 14
reliable flux calibrators. For these targets, the residuals from the match
between the model best-fit models and the observed spectra across the full
wavelength range are < 3%, with the exception of the UV regions affected by the
ozone Huggins bands (300 nm - 340 nm) and regions contaminated by telluric
lines. Results. We have identified and fully characterised 14 DA white dwarfs
that can be used as spectrophotometric standard stars for the MICADO instrument
as well as any other future instrument with similar requirements in the
brightness range, K = 14 to 16 mag (Vegamag), and provide reference fluxes

### [16] [Stacked Hybrid RNN-CNN Reconstruction of X-ray Influence on 21-cm Brightness Temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05842)
*S. Mobina Hosseini,Bahareh Soleimanpour Salmasi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid deep learning model that accurately and efficiently emulates the impact of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the Epoch of Reionization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational challenges of traditional simulations in exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces related to X-ray effects on the 21-cm line observables during the Epoch of Reionization.

Method: The authors used a stacked hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to emulate the effects of X-ray flux without requiring repeated simulations.

Result: The emulator achieves a prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, reduces computation time by a factor of one million, and generalizes well to unseen parameter combinations with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator effectively reconstructs the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR with high accuracy and significantly reduces computation time.

Abstract: The X-ray photons substantially affect the thermal and ionization states of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), thereby
significantly influencing the 21-cm line observables such as its sky-averaged
(global) brightness temperature. Nevertheless, the complicated dependency of
astrophysical processes on a broad spectrum of parameters, including X-ray
efficiency, spectral characteristics, and gas dynamics, makes precisely
simulating the effect of X-ray flux challenging. Traditional approaches,
including N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, are computationally intensive
and struggle to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces efficiently. We
present a stacked hybrid model trained on a specific simulation intended to
reconstruct the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature
during the EoR. Along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this
architecture combines two substantial forms of recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), therefore
enabling fast adaptation to several X-ray flux levels. Without demanding
repeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies
and generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces
computation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent
prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional
parameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK.
Our LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to
enable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global
21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated wavelength calibration method using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), demonstrating its effectiveness in spectral data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to present an automated, accurate, and robust approach for wavelength calibration of one-dimensional spectra, especially since DTW has not been widely used in astronomical data analysis.

Method: The method involves using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with a calibrated template spectrum to recover dispersion solutions, demonstrated within a Python data reduction framework.

Result: DTW successfully handles spectral data with differing resolutions, spurious or missing features, and performs effectively in both simulated and real-world arc lamp spectra.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DTW is an effective algorithm for wavelength calibration in spectral data analysis, offering robustness and flexibility in handling non-linear and discontinuous dispersion solutions.

Abstract: Here we present an automated method for obtaining wavelength calibrations for
one-dimensional spectra, using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW is a flexible
and well-understood algorithm for pattern matching, which has not been widely
used in astronomy data analysis. Employing a calibrated template spectrum as a
reference, DTW can recover non-linear and even discontinuous dispersion
solutions without an initial guess. The algorithm is robust against differing
spectral resolution between the template and sample data, and can accommodate
some spurious or missing features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DTW in
an automated data reduction workflow, using both simulated and real arc lamp
spectra in a Python data reduction framework. Finally, we provide a discussion
on the utility and best practices with the DTW algorithm for wavelength
calibration. We also introduce the PyKOSMOS data reduction toolkit, which
includes our DTW calibration methods.

### [18] [Investigating the origin of the Milky Way streams. A revised look at their orbital pole distribution in light of precession effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05733)
*Elena Asencio,Pavel Kroupa,Ingo Thies*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This study analyzes Milky Way stellar streams and finds that their orbital alignment with the disc of satellite galaxies increases with distance from the Galactic center, indicating precession influences nearby streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if Milky Way streams have a common origin with the disc of satellite galaxies and young halo globular clusters by analyzing their orbital pole distribution.

Method: Analyzed orbital pole distribution of 91 Milky Way streams using the galstreams dataset and applied distance cuts to assess alignment with the disc of satellite galaxies. Hydrodynamical simulations were also used to validate findings.

Result: Streams closer to the Galactic center show no preferred orbital direction, but streams farther away align more with the disc of satellite galaxies, suggesting precession effects.

Conclusion: Stellar streams farther from the Galactic center show a higher alignment with the disc of satellite galaxies, suggesting that precession affects the orbital poles of streams closer to the center.

Abstract: Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into
its history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that
several MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of
satellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given
that many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In
this work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole
distribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For
a sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d<100$ kpc we find that
the pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we
subtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower
distance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the
streams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction
similar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole
distribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the
orbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole
distribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample,
we infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to
be affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical
simulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common
origin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated
until the selected sample also includes material at $d \gtrsim 150$ kpc.

TL;DR: JADES-GS-z13-1-LA的观测表明其可能是高红移AGN候选体，有助于理解早期宇宙的再电离过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JADES-GS-z13-1-LA是目前观测到的最高红移Lyα发射体，其发现对理解早期宇宙的再电离过程和星系演化具有重要意义。

Method: 利用再电离的辐射转移模拟，结合JADES-GS-z13-1-LA的观测数据，分析其对宇宙再电离的含义以及其是否包含AGN。

Result: JADES-GS-z13-1-LA的检测可能表明宇宙在z=13时已经电离超过5%；其光谱特征（如Lyα阻尼翼吸收和可能的CII*发射线）提示其可能包含AGN。

Conclusion: JADES-GS-z13-1-LA的研究表明，如果这是一个典型的恒星形成星系，宇宙在z=13时电离度超过5%；若其包含AGN，则其包含AGN的概率在不同IGM电离度下分别为88%、66%和33%。

Abstract: The JADES survey recently reported the discovery of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z =
13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This
observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding
JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$
emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of
reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM
to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find
that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with
properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that
the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the
possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an
AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce
more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that
JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $<
1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight
other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of
AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to
$\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our
findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of
JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.

Motivation: 为了准确统计宇宙时间尺度上的尘埃遮蔽恒星形成，从而全面了解宇宙恒星形成历史。

Method: 利用PRIMER JWST NIRCam和HST COSMOS光学数据，从1 < z < 8范围内选取了777个尘埃遮蔽的红星系样本，通过SED分析其恒星形成率和恒星质量。

Result: 样本中的尘埃遮蔽星系显示出中位恒星形成率约为40太阳质量每年，恒星质量中位为log(M*/M☉) = 10.3，红星系在z=3.3时占质量大于10太阳质量星系的72%，在z≈7时上升至91%。在z≈6时，这些红星系的数量密度足以解释z>3时静止星系的丰度，并且在z≈4和z≈5时对恒星形成率密度的贡献显著。

Conclusion: 红星系在高红移时对恒星形成率密度有显著贡献，并且其数量足以解释高红移静止星系的丰度，未来更深更广的ALMA巡天将进一步加强和扩展本研究的结果。

Abstract: A comprehensive account of the cosmic star-formation history demands an
accurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide
strong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based
on their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777
galaxies spans $1 < z < 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST
COSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that
these dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\mathrm{SFR \sim
40M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) =
10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full
JWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that
red galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \% of galaxies with
$\log(M/M_{\odot}) > 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\% by $z \sim 7$ (albeit
with large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the
number density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6$ is sufficient
to explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$, consistent with
typical quenching timescales allowed in the $\mathrm{\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from
$z \sim 6$ to $z \sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial
contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \sim 4$, red
galaxies provide $\mathrm {\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-2}
M_{\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \% of the
total $\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected
dusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper
and wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and
extend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of
dust-obscured activity to $\rho_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ at high redshifts.

TL;DR: Eridu是一个位于高红移（z=2.675）的大质量熄灭星系，其恒星形成在宇宙早期快速完成，表现出极端α增强特征，并挑战了当前的星系形成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Eridu星系有助于理解早期宇宙中大质量熄灭星系的形成与演化，以及探索环境机制（如大质量并合）在星系演化中的作用。

Method: 结合JWST/NIRSpec光谱数据和JADES+SMILES的多波段测光数据，对Eridu星系的质量、恒星形成历史、化学丰度等性质进行了建模分析。

Result: Eridu是一个大质量、α增强的熄灭星系，其恒星质量为log(M*/M☉) = 10.96，过去1亿年内平均恒星形成率低于1 M☉/yr，其恒星形成历史显示其在大爆炸后约3亿年内快速形成，并在观测前20亿年（z~10）停止形成恒星。此外，Eridu所在的原结构可能通过环境机制促进了其快速质量组装和熄灭。

Conclusion: Eridu的发现对当前的星系形成理论提出了挑战，表明在宇宙黎明时期可能存在比目前观测到的更早、更重的星系。未来的研究和模型将有助于揭示这种星系的形成机制。

Abstract: We present the analysis of an ancient galaxy at $z=2.675$ which we dub
``Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra
from the SMILES program and $0.4-25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ HST, JWST/NIRCam, and
JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that
Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass
$\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})=10.96^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and average star formation
rate $<1\ \mathrm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$ over the last 100 Myr. Star formation
histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast
formation within $\sim300$ Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to
observation ($z\sim10$). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor
of Eridu had $M_*\approx10^{11}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z>10$, nearly two orders
of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations.
From Eridu's spectrum we infer $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} =+0.65^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$,
indicating its stellar population is extremely $\alpha$-enhanced, which is
consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation
history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional
explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental
mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with
observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future
high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population
modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.

Abstract: We present a method for accurately and precisely inferring photometric dust
extinction towards stars at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic
machine learning to model the colour-magnitude distribution of zero-extinction
stars in these regions. Photometric dust maps rely on a robust method for
inferring stellar reddening. At high Galactic latitudes, where extinction is
low, such inferences are particularly susceptible to contamination from
modelling errors and prior assumptions, potentially introducing artificial
structure into dust maps. In this work, we demonstrate the use of normalising
flows to learn the conditional probability distribution of the photometric
colour-magnitude relations of zero-extinction stars, conditioned on Galactic
cylindrical coordinates for stars within 2.5 kpc at mid-to-high Galactic
latitudes. By using the normalising flow to model the colour-magnitude diagram,
we infer the posterior distribution of dust extinction towards stars along
different lines of sight by marginalising over the flow. We validate our method
using data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS, showing that we recover unbiased
posteriors and successfully detect dust along the line of sight in two
calibration regions at mid-Galactic latitude that have been extensively studied
in the context of polarisation surveys.

TL;DR: Molecular clouds in the Milky Way can form stars even when their virial parameter exceeds the critical threshold, with star formation influenced by environmental conditions and turbulence dissipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the gravitational binding and star-forming properties of molecular clouds in the Milky Way and how these properties vary with galactocentric radius.

Method: The analysis uses CO cloud observations from two surveys with the standard CO conversion factor, along with a model of pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE).

Result: The virial parameter α_vir increases with galactocentric radius; PVE models match observations only if cloud and stellar surface densities are comparable; many clouds form stars despite having α_vir > 2; simulations show that clouds with dissipating turbulence can form stars; predicted star-forming ages and YSO counts align with observations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that molecular clouds in the Milky Way can form stars even when their virial parameter exceeds the critical value, and this process is influenced by environmental factors and dissipating turbulence.

Abstract: The gravitational binding and star-forming properties of molecular clouds
(MCs) in the Milky Way (MW) are estimated from CO cloud observations and from a
model of pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE). Two CO surveys are analyzed
with the standard CO conversion factor. The main results are: (1) For each
survey the cloud virial parameter $\alpha_{vir}$ increases by a factor ~2 from
galactocentric radius $R_{gal}$ = 4 kpc to 15 kpc. (2) PVE models match these
trends only if the surface densities of survey clouds and nearby stars are
comparable. This evidence of environmental influence resembles that seen in
other disk galaxies. (3) Many survey clouds form stars even though their virial
parameter exceeds the critical value $\alpha_{vir}\approx2$. In PVE such clouds
with constant velocity dispersion have stable equilibrium and cannot form stars
by simple global collapse. (4) However, simulations show that
$\alpha_{vir}\approx2$ clouds with dissipating turbulence may form filaments,
cores and protostars with little global contraction. Such clouds can match the
MW star formation rate if their protostellar cores have mass fraction
~10$^{-3}$. A simple model predicts that the star-forming age of a cloud is
proportional to the ratio of its YSOs to its mass. (5) Clouds within ~500 pc of
the Sun are predicted to have star-forming ages 1-10 Myr and average YSO age ~2
Myr, matching evolutionary models. The Orion A cloud is predicted to have ~60
Class 0 protostars, ~2900 YSOs and efficiency $SFE\approx0.02$, in good
agreement with observed estimates.

TL;DR: This study explores how magnetic field structures and filament line-mass distributions change in hub-filament systems during star formation, identifying 'double-node' star formation as a common evolutionary feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify indicators of HFS evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses, by examining magnetic field structures and filament line-mass distributions.

Method: The analysis combines new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized emission with archival infrared and radio data to examine magnetic field structures and dense gas distributions in three HFS.

Result: The study observes changes in the filament line-mass function, polarization fraction, and magnetic field-filament alignment as HFS evolve, with the emergence of 'double-node' star formation as a common feature.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the evolution of hub-filament systems (HFS) is marked by changes in filament line-mass function, polarization fraction, and magnetic field-filament alignment, with implications for understanding star formation processes across different evolutionary stages.

Abstract: In this study, we examine three cluster-forming hub-filament systems (HFS) -
W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to
advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and
filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS
evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our
analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar
populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized
emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival
infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We
derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct
filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization
intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation
between B-fields and filaments.
  As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF),
PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also
increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the
plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent
with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity
between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where
two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a
common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across
several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.

criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types,
which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron
low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic
observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter
telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter
telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at
Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband
photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during
the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted
cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of
$44.9<\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)<48.0$ at redshifts
between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable
resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their
environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.

Abstract: We present results from our EVN and GMRT observations of the radio continuum
and spectral line emission in IRAS 17526+3253, along with an analysis of its
arcsecond-scale radio properties using archival VLA data. The EVN observations
detected radio continuum emission from both the northwest (NW) and southeast
(SE) nuclei. The NW nucleus shows two components with high brightness
temperatures and radio luminosities, likely indicating the presence of an AGN
core and jet. Meanwhile, our EVN observation failed to detect the OH line
emission, possibly due to radio frequency interference and/or the emission
being partly resolved out and below our detection limit. The multi-band radio
spectral energy distribution (SED) deviates from a single power-law at low
frequencies, suggesting low-frequency absorption. The GMRT spectral line data
reveal both \HI absorption and emission. The \HI emission is diffuse and shows
a velocity gradient from about 7500 \kms in the NW to 7800 \kms in the SE
nucleus. On larger scales, the \HI emission extends about 4' along the NW-SE
direction, with the southeastern extension matching the optical tidal tail. In
addition, the weak \HI absorption features show broad line profiles, possibly
due to overlapping \HI gas from the two nuclei. The aforementioned results are
consistent with properties of intermediate-stage mergers reported in the
literature.

TL;DR: This paper shows that two colliding clouds shaped by supernova remnants may have formed the IRDC G035.39-00.33 and potentially triggered star formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how shocks from galactic bubbles or cloud-cloud collisions shape molecular clouds and potentially trigger star formation.

Method: Analyzed SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission using new large-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope; examined gas morphology and kinematics, including position-velocity diagrams.

Result: Identified two filaments with differing velocities and orientations, connected by a bridge feature typical of cloud-cloud collisions; found evidence of interactions with supernova remnants and an expanding shell.

Conclusion: The two filaments in IRDC G035.39-00.33 are the densest parts of two colliding clouds driven by nearby supernova remnants, and this cloud-cloud collision might have assembled the infrared dark cloud, potentially triggering star formation.

Abstract: Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape
molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both
driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific
signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such
signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds
formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the
shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC
G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at
the Instituto de Radioastronom\`ia Millim\'etrica. We find that the dense gas
is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different
velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments
are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a
position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature,
typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow
SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with
the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also
report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely
driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell.
The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our
preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We
conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding
clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate
that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled
the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation
may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.

### [28] [Revisiting the Gas Dynamics of Henize 2-10: Possible Drivers of the Starburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06472)
*Josephine M. Dalsin,Allison H. Costa,Remy Indebetouw,Kelsey E. Johnson,Natalie O. Johnson,Sabrina Stierwalt*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This paper investigates what triggers starburst episodes in the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, finding evidence that a large CO feature may be falling into the galaxy and causing the starburst, rather than a previous merger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the triggers of starburst episodes is crucial for comprehending the baryon cycle in galaxies, especially in dwarf galaxies which are expected to dominate the merger rate.

Method: New VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data were used to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in Henize 2-10. A meta-analysis of available results was also conducted.

Result: The study did not detect an HI tail consistent with a previously reported structure suggesting a merger. Instead, it found an extended HI distribution and dynamically decoupled HI and CO features, indicating large-scale dynamical processes affecting the gas.

Conclusion: The starburst episode in Henize 2-10 may be triggered by a large CO feature falling into the galaxy, rather than a previous merger, based on new observations indicating an extended HI distribution and dynamically decoupled HI and CO features.

Abstract: The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding
of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested
catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single
kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to
assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to
dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such
dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which
appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst
episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy
itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA
21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the
dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an
HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995),
which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these
new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI
appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a
tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of
some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of
available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the
starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could
be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the behavior of the pion under different kinematic conditions.

Method: Computational techniques are employed to extract energy eigenvalues through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph.

Result: The dispersion relation of the pion is plotted and compared with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion:  lattice QCD simulations align with theoretical expectations.

Abstract: In this report, computational techniques are employed to extract the energy
eigenvalues of the pion from two-point correlation function data that has been
simulated using the lattice formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) across
various momentum values for the particle. The analysis focuses on
systematically obtaining these eigenvalues to understand better the behavior of
the pion under different kinematic conditions. Once extracted, these energy
eigenvalues obtained through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph, are
utilized to plot the dispersion relation of the pion. This resulting dispersion
relation is then compared with theoretical predictions to assess the accuracy
and validity of the computational approach. The comparison provides insights
into how well the lattice QCD simulations align with established theoretical
expectations, and what range of kinematic variables are reliable.

### [30] [A lattice study of two dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05967)
*Rajamani Narayanan,Ray Romero*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper investigates massless overlap fermions in two-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories, showing that only one class of lattice gauge fields survives in the continuum limit. The authors define a topological condensate with a non-zero expectation value and demonstrate the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit, consistent across multiple fermion representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding how massless overlap fermions behave in two-dimensional SU(Nc) gauge theories, particularly focusing on the survival of certain partition functions in the continuum limit and the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit.

Method: Numerical simulations are used to examine lattice gauge fields and fermion zero modes in two-dimensional SU(Nc) gauge theories. The authors analyze spectral density, scaling of the lowest eigenvalue, and define modified partition functions to study the behavior of fermion bilinears and zero modes.

Result: The study finds that only one class of lattice gauge fields survives in the continuum limit, depending on the boundary conditions. The topological condensate exhibits a non-zero expectation value on finite and infinite tori, and there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking, although zero modes emerge in the infinite volume limit.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit for SU(2) with a single Majorana fermion, and a non-zero expectation value for a fermion bilinear is established through modified partition functions, which they refer to as the topological condensate. Additionally, the results are consistent across different integer representations of the fermion.

Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional
$SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its
spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice
gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set
of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a
single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical
evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and
this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As
such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum
limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero
modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define
an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition
functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has
a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a
non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the
spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the
size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but
the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited
in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These
results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces
the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition
function.

### [31] [Conformal Gravity as a Deformed Topological Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05683)
*James A. Reid*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores a reformulation of general relativity by treating the MacDowell-Mansouri connection's length scale as a dynamic field, showing that the resulting field equations match the conformal Einstein equations and revealing a distinct geometrical interpretation via Cartan geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore how treating the fundamental length scale of the MacDowell-Mansouri connection as a dynamic field affects the formulation of general relativity and to investigate the resulting field equations' equivalence to the conformal Einstein equations.

Method: The researchers utilized the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, treating the fundamental length scale as a dynamical cosmological scalar field, and applied variational principles to derive field equations. They then analyzed the geometrical properties using Cartan geometry.

Result: The field equations derived from the modified action were shown to be equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on shell. The geometrical analysis revealed that spacetime points are approximated by homogeneous spaces whose radii depend on the cosmological scalar field.

Conclusion: The study concludes that by treating the fundamental length scale of the MacDowell-Mansouri connection as a dynamical cosmological scalar field, the field equations from the action variation equate to the conformal Einstein equations, highlighting a geometrical distinction between general relativity and its conformal version through Cartan geometry.

Abstract: In the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, the spin
connection and coframe variables are incorporated into a single Lie
algebra-valued connection called the MacDowell-Mansouri connection, $\omega$.
From the curvature form $F$ of $\omega$ and an auxiliary field, $B$, one may
formulate general relativity as a deformed topological field theory by
constructing an action functional whose variation yields a set of field
equations that are equivalent to the Einstein equations on shell. In this
article, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the
MacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a
cosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of
the resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on
shell. Through the lens of Cartan geometry, we then discuss a notable
geometrical difference between general relativity and its conformally
transformed counterpart. Specifically, for the latter, we show that points in
spacetime are infinitesimally approximated by homogeneous spaces (restricted to
a point) whose radii are parameterised by the value of the cosmological scalar
field.

Conclusion: 该论文得出了一种基于紧化几何和介质激发的可观测量耦合和阻止本领的新方法，并支持与各向异性、非线性响应以及实验室尺度系统中的引力或额外维效应相关现象的研究。

Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive
collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired,
five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification,
obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are
treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is
encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic
and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim
\Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 =
\frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied,
the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large
$R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative
approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to
determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically
supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as
gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the
study of stopping power and particle range.

Conclusion: 研究发现，在Horndeski理论空间中存在广泛的弱引力孤岛，并且通过替换ΛCDM膨胀模型为DESI的w0waCDM最佳拟合，也可以产生稳定的弱引力孤岛。

Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing
on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This
letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity
theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling
stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the
inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently
released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis
functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the
stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on
models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at
late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a
dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We
find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also
include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$,
and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force.
Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI
$w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a perturbative hyperboloidal extraction method for gravitational waves, offering a simple and efficient approach with quality comparable to existing methods, though without capturing nonlinear wave propagation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gravitational-wave extraction in numerical relativity simulations, particularly for practical applications.

Method: The method uses numerical relativity data as the inner boundary for a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity.

Result: The method produces gravitational waveforms with data quality comparable to Cauchy characteristic extraction, demonstrated through simulations of gravitational collapse, binary black hole mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers.

Conclusion: The perturbative hyperboloidal extraction method is a simple and efficient procedure for computing gravitational waves, serving as a foundation for more advanced hyperboloidal schemes in gravitational-wave extraction.

Abstract: We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves
computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical
relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as
the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null
infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational
collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering,
and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation
methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet
efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable
to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications.
Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but
the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal
schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，通过使用量子钟，可以在低能量下探测量子引力效应，并且在适当准备相干态的情况下，时间测量的密度矩阵不仅匹配经典的时间膨胀值，还显示出围绕峰值的高斯轮廓的量子涨落。

Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our
current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly
assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much
larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the
superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems
whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very
promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this
work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant
formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account
for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings
with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the
(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when
attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in
terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When
this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even
with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We
then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of
quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)
charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our
clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix
$\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields
not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical
expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum
fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.

TL;DR: This study explores how IR/UV mixing in quantum gravity affects cold-atom interferometry, revealing bounds on the Planck-length scale and offering a solution to a discrepancy in measurements of the fine structure constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the effects of IR/UV mixing, a feature found in several quantum-gravity approaches, on observable phenomena and to understand discrepancies in measurements of the fine structure constant.

Method: The study derives the implications of 'soft' IR/UV mixing using recent cold-atom-interferometry measurements and analyzes the correction term in the dispersion relation linear in momentum.

Result: The research establishes bounds on the characteristic length scale related to IR/UV mixing, reaching the Planck-length milestone, and finds a potential resolution to the fine structure constant measurement discrepancy.

Conclusion: IR/UV mixing can offer a solution to the discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric measurements of the fine structure constant, with the characteristic scale being approximately half the Planck length.

Abstract: IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to
manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature
found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the
implications for "soft" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation
that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry
measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish
bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length
milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half
the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling
discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric
measurements of the fine structure constant.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of using non-classical states in early universe cosmology predictions, finding that while the background behavior remains almost classical, power spectrum predictions can differ significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to explore the effects of the quantum nature of gravity on primordial perturbations generated during inflation, specifically focusing on the assumption of a single close-to-classical state over which perturbations grow.

Method: The paper presents a scenario that allows the background state to be non-classical by defining quantum trajectories through an eikonal approximation.

Result: The result of the paper is that even though the background state can be non-classical, the quantum trajectories asymptotically reproduce an almost classical behavior for the background, although the predictions for the power spectrum of perturbations can significantly differ.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that quantum trajectories can asymptotically reproduce classical behavior for the background, but the predictions for the power spectrum of perturbations may significantly differ.

Abstract: Predictions from early universe cosmology typically concern primordial
perturbations generated during epochs where effects arising from the quantum
nature of gravity may be important; quantum vacuum fluctuations being stretched
to cosmological scales during a phase of inflation. Quantizing the background
is then done by assuming a single close-to-classical state over which
perturbations grow, as well as a Born-Oppenheimer factorization throughout the
relevant phase. We present a scenario in which although the latter
factorization remains valid at all times, we allow the background state to be
very non-classical by defining quantum trajectories through an eikonal
approximation. We find that these trajectories asymptotically reproduce an
almost classical behavior for the background, but the predictions for the power
spectrum of perturbations can significantly differ.

Abstract: Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure
Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the
underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work,
we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in
the ambit of perturbed Kepler problem, and explore their impact on eccentric
orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional
parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions,
our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more
natural to trace the physical origins of various model parameters. Starting
from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute
the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their
observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework
thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit to probe such subtle
effects in gravitational wave data.

*Erik Amorim*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents new solutions to Einstein's equations coupled with generalized electromagnetism, showing that a point charge can produce finite energy and weaker singularities compared to classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of infinite electric-field energy and strong singularities in the Reissner-Weyl-Nordström solution of the conventional Einstein-Maxwell equations.

Method: The researchers solved the Einstein Field Equations coupled with the Maxwell-Bopp-Landé-Thomas-Podolsky electromagnetic equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime with a point charge.

Result: A family of solutions was found where the point charge, modeled as a naked singularity with non-positive bare mass, results in a milder singularity and finite electric-field energy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the electric-field energy in the new spacetime solutions is finite, and the singularity at the point charge is less severe compared to the Reissner-Weyl-Nordström solution.

Abstract: We establish the existence of a family of static, spherically symmetric
spacetimes that are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations of General
Relativity coupled to the electric field of a static point charge obeying the
equations of electromagnetism of Maxwell-Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky. The
point charge is modeled as a naked singularity with non-positive bare mass. The
singularity at the location of the charge is milder than that of the
Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om solution to the conventional Einstein-Maxwell
equations, and, contrary to what happens for the latter, the electric-field
energy of these solutions is finite.

*Alexandre Landry,Yassine Sekhmani,Emmanuel N. Saridakis,Sunil K Maurya,Akram Ali*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents new wormhole solutions in teleparallel massive gravity, showing it is a viable framework for modeling traversable wormholes without a cosmological constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the possibility of exact, static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in a modified gravity framework combining teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity and the dRGT graviton mass term.

Method: The researchers used the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function and integrated dRGT-modified conservation laws with teleparallel field equations to reconstruct the shape function and teleparallel solutions.

Result: The study produced novel wormhole solutions accommodating pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, verified flaring-out conditions, absence of event horizons, and adherence or controlled violation of null and weak energy conditions at the throat.

Conclusion: Teleparallel massive gravity is a self-consistent and mathematically rich framework for asymptotically flat wormhole geometries and does not require an explicit cosmological constant.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically
symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity
augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term.
By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function
including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously
integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel
field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible
torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate
both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed
via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition
$b'(r_0)<1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null
and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only
controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel
massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for
asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an
explicit cosmological constant.

Abstract: Motivated by future opportunities in gravitational-wave astronomy and the
ongoing effort to constrain physics under extreme conditions, we consider the
signature of individual mode resonances excited during the inspiral of binary
systems involving neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify how each resonant
mode contributes to the effective (frequency-dependent) tidal deformability.
The resonant solution is shown to be accurately represented by a new
closed-form approximation, which sheds light on the involved phenomenology, and
which should be useful for the development of precise waveform models and
future parameter extraction efforts.

TL;DR: This paper derives a precise space-time area expression for hadronization modeling, validates the STAL principle in the UCLA model, and enables a unified treatment of heavy and light hadrons using a single fragmentation function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better model strongly interacting phenomena, particularly hadronization, by validating the space-time area law (STAL) principle and unifying the treatment of heavy and light hadrons.

Method: The authors derived an exact expression for space-time areas related to hadronic events for hadrons of any mass and applied it to the UCLA hadronization model.

Result: An exact expression for relevant space-time areas was successfully derived and applied to the UCLA model, supporting the STAL principle and enabling a unified approach to hadron fragmentation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the usage of the exact expression for space-time areas in the UCLA hadronization model validates the STAL principle and unifies the treatment of heavy and light hadrons through a single fragmentation function.

Abstract: Space-time area laws play a fundamental role in modeling strongly interacting
phenomena, such as in relativistic string models, QCD on the lattice, and in
hadronization modeling. For the latter, an exact expression for relevant
space-time areas related to the final state hadronic events for hadrons of any
mass is calculated. Usage of this expression in the UCLA hadronization model
helps validate its space-time area law (STAL) principle and unifies the
treatment of heavy and light hadrons via a single fragmentation function.

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) direct detection is now standing at an interesting juncture,
where the Standard Model (SM) neutrino background and the upper bound on the DM
signal cross section are starting to overlap in the DM mass region around 10
GeV. The neutrino floor, which defines the extent of the neutrino background,
can be modified in different Beyond Standard Model (BSM) setups. We work in a
simple BSM dark sector extension of the SM visible sector, where
isospin-violating interactions occur naturally. In this model, both DM and
neutrinos have, in general, isospin-violating (IV) interactions with nuclei,
through a newly added local U(1) gauge boson $Z^{\prime}$. Depending on the
choice of the model parameters, the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering (CE$\mathrm{\nu}$NS) cross section can either increase or decrease,
shifting up or down the neutrino floor in the parameter space. The same is true
for the DM experimental upper bound, whose change is driven exclusively by the
IV parameter $f_n/f_p$. Several scenarios are constructed, based on the
interplay between the two regions and the allowed parameter space left between
them, and discussed. The potential observation of solar neutrinos in DM direct
detection experiments is also discussed in the context of our framework.

Abstract: We consider the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) distribution of Drell-Yan lepton
pairs produced with invariant masses ($M$) from low values up to the $Z$-boson
peak ($4\leq M \leq 116$~GeV). We present perturbative predictions obtained by
consistently combining the resummation of logarithmically enhanced QCD
corrections at small $q_T$ ($q_T \ll M$) up to
next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy with the available
fixed-order calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (i.e.
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$) valid at large $q_T$. For very low $q_T$ ($q_T\sim
\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$), non-perturbative (NP) QCD effects become dominant and
have been included through a NP form factor with a small number of
free-parameters. We compare our results with multiple experimental datasets
from hadron colliders, finding excellent agreement between theory and data. By
fitting the NP parameters, we achieve a precise extraction of the NP form
factor and the so-called Collins-Soper kernel.

We use an improved version of the fixed center approximation to the Faddeev
equations which fulfills exact elastic unitarity at the threshold of the

determine the scattering length, effective range and correlation functions of
these systems, showing that the results contain important information to test
the assumed molecular nature of the two $D_{s1}$ states.

*Johannes K. L. Michel*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes Yukawa Fragmentation Asymmetries as a new method to study Higgs boson interactions with light quarks, showing improved sensitivity at the HL-LHC and highlighting connections between confinement and Higgs sector exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand Yukawa couplings of light quarks with the Higgs boson, which are difficult to probe directly, by identifying unique azimuthal modulations in hadron fragmentation patterns.

Method: The authors introduce Yukawa Fragmentation Asymmetries (YFAs) as observables derived from Yukawa interactions. They analyze these asymmetries using a case study of $VH$ production with a tagged target fragmentation hadron at the HL-LHC.

Result: The results show that YFAs are linearly proportional to real or CP-odd Yukawa couplings and are competitive with current HL-LHC sensitivities for second-generation couplings, outperforming them by a factor of 2-3 for first-generation couplings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Yukawa Fragmentation Asymmetries (YFAs) offer a novel and competitive method for studying Yukawa couplings, particularly for first-generation quarks, and highlight synergies between studies of confinement and the Higgs sector.

Abstract: We point out that Yukawa interactions of light quarks with the Higgs boson
are imprinted as unique azimuthal modulations in the density of fragmentation
hadrons relative to the Higgs $p_T$. We introduce Yukawa Fragmentation
Asymmetries (YFAs), interference observables that are linearly proportional to
real (Standard Model) or CP-odd Yukawa couplings, respectively. The chiral
suppression is lifted nonperturbatively by chiral-odd multi-hadron
fragmentation functions. As a case study, we consider $VH$ production with a
tagged target fragmentation hadron at the HL-LHC. We estimate that the YFAs
from this single example process are already competitive with current projected
HL-LHC sensitivities for second-generation couplings, and outperform them by a
factor of 2-3 for first-generation couplings. Our results point to deep
synergies between precision studies of confinement and the in-depth exploration
of the Higgs sector.

Motivation: Belle II实验及其他正在进行和计划中的轻子设施预计将显著提高对τ轻子电偶极矩（EDM）和反常磁矩（g-2）的灵敏度，因此探索能够预测这些可观测量的模型具有重要时效性。

Method: 作者研究了通过辐射τ质量生成机制来产生τ轻子EDM和g-2的一类模型，并分析了两个具有不同超荷分配的基准模型。

Result: 第一个包含中性费米子和带电标量粒子的模型可预测较大的τ EDM信号（约为10^-19 e cm）和g-2信号（约为10^-5），而第二个包含带电费米子和中性标量粒子的模型则预测了类似的g-2但较小的EDM信号。

Conclusion: 这些模型作为预测显著τ轻子EDM和g-2的新物理基准模型，有助于未来实验对这些可观测量的进一步验证。

Abstract: The Belle II experiment and other ongoing and projected lepton facilities are
expected to greatly enhance the sensitivity to the electric dipole moment (EDM)
and anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) for the tau lepton, making it timely to
explore models that predict these observables. We present a class of models
that generate a sizable EDM and $g-2$ of the tau lepton via radiative tau mass
generation. Two benchmark models with different hypercharge assignments are
investigated. The first model contains neutral fermions and charged scalars. We
find that the model can predict a large signal of the tau EDM, $d_{\tau} =
\mathcal{O}(10^{-19}) \, e \, {\rm cm}$, and $g-2$, $a_{\tau} =
\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, which are within the reach of future updates of their
measurements. In contrast, the second model, containing a charged fermion and
neutral scalars, yields a similar magnitude for the $g-2$ but predicts a
comparatively smaller EDM signal. Our models serve as benchmarks for new
physics generating sizable EDM and $g-2$ of the tau lepton.

TL;DR: This paper explores dark matter production via co-scattering in an extended EFT model, identifying parameter spaces consistent with observed relic density and LHC constraints, with potential for further study at the HL-LHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in a model containing new Z2-odd particles, aiming to explain the observed dark matter relic density and explore its detectability at the LHC.

Method: The study uses an EFT framework with new Z2-odd singlets and performs a parameter scan over masses and couplings to determine the dark matter relic density, focusing on co-scattering and co-annihilation mechanisms while considering constraints from the ATLAS mono-γ search.

Result: The researchers identified two benchmark points where either co-scattering or co-annihilation predominantly determines the dark matter relic abundance, and they found regions of parameter space consistent with both the observed relic density and LHC constraints.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there is a viable parameter space where the dark matter relic abundance is primarily determined by the co-scattering mechanism and remains consistent with LHC constraints, suggesting potential for further exploration at the HL-LHC through the mono-γ signature.

Abstract: We investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in an
EFT framework which contains new $Z_2$-odd singlets, namely two fermions
$N_{1,2}$ and a real scalar $\chi$. The singlet scalar $\chi$ is the dark
matter candidate. The dimension-5 operators play a vital role to set the
observed DM relic density. We focus on a nearly degenerate mass spectrum for
the $Z_2$ odd particles to allow for a significant contribution from the
co-scattering or co-annihilation mechanisms. We present two benchmark points
where either of the two mechanisms primarily set the DM relic abundance. The
main constraint on the model at the LHC arise from the ATLAS mono-$\gamma$
search. We obtain the parameter space allowed by the observed relic density and
the mono-$\gamma$ search after performing a scan over the key parameters, the
masses $M_{N_{1,2}}, M_\chi$ and couplings $c_3^\prime, Y^\prime_{11,22}$. We
find the region of parameter space where the relic abundance is set primarily
by the co-scattering mechanism while being allowed by the LHC search. We also
determine how the model can be further probed at the HL-LHC via the
mono-$\gamma$ signature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the bound-state energy spectrum of quarkonium systems by applying an approximate analytical method to a realistic potential model, namely the Cornell potential.

Method: The researchers used the semiclassical WKB approximation and a Taylor series expansion of the Cornell potential around a chosen point $ r_0 $ to analytically solve the Schrödinger equation for quark-antiquark systems.

Result: An approximate quantization condition was derived, yielding energy levels that reflect the essential dynamics of quarkonium systems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the WKB method effectively models hadronic bound states, particularly for quarkonium systems, by simplifying the Cornell potential and solving the Schrödinger equation analytically.

Abstract: In this study, we analyze the bound-state energy spectrum of quark-antiquark
systems using the semiclassical WKB approximation. We consider the Cornell
potential, which combines a linear confinement term with a Coulombic
interaction, and perform a Taylor series expansion around an appropriately
chosen point $r_{0}$ to simplify the potential near the classical turning
points. This expansion enables an analytic treatment of the Schr\"odinger
equation within the leading-order WKB framework. The resulting quantization
condition yields approximate energy levels that capture the essential dynamics
of quarkonium systems and illustrate the utility of the WKB method in modeling
hadronic bound states.

Abstract: We investigate the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off a
tensor-polarized spin-1 target, focusing on the production of an unpolarized
hadron. The complete differential cross section is expressed in terms of 23
structure functions, which depend on the spin states of the target and the
azimuthal modulations of the final-state hadron. Within the transverse momentum
dependent (TMD) factorization framework, we derive the hadronic tensor using
quark-quark correlators and quark-gluon-quark correlators up to twist-3. At
tree-level, 21 nonvanishing structure functions are obtained at the leading and
subleading twist, expressed as convolutions of TMD parton distribution
functions and TMD fragmentation functions. The measurement of these nonzero
structure functions can be utilized to explore the tensor-polarized structure
of spin-1 particles, offering insights into their internal dynamics.

induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be
observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mechanism of supersymmetry violating mass spectrum in the Exotic Model without relying on spontaneous or explicit supersymmetry breaking.

Method: This paper discusses the theoretical framework and issues involved in calculating the mass splitting in the Exotic Model, which involves a special exotic invariant altering supersymmetry algebra.

Result: The mass splitting occurs at tree level with gauge symmetry breaking in the Z and X vector boson supermultiplets and extends to other particles at one loop.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the mass splitting in the Exotic Model can be calculated with the help of computer programs.

Abstract: The Exotic Model arises from adding a special exotic invariant to the

mass spectrum without using spontaneous or explicit breaking of supersymmetry.
The splitting arises with gauge symmetry breaking, at tree level, in the
supermultiplets of the Z vector boson and a new X vector boson. It spreads to
the other particles at one loop. This mass splitting is possible because the
exotic invariant changes the algebra of supersymmetry. This paper E7 discusses
a number of issues that arise in the calculation of the mass splitting of the
Exotic Model. That mass splitting will require computer programs for solution.

### [55] [Illuminating Degenerate Dark Sector of Inert Doublet Model at Muon Collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06289)

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This study investigates the use of a forward muon facility at a future muon collider to probe the degenerate scalar dark sector within the Inert Scalar Doublet Model (IDM), offering a potential breakthrough in dark matter research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and detect the challenging degenerate scalar dark sector, which is difficult to probe at current facilities like the LHC due to soft decay products and small production cross-sections.

Method: The study investigates the feasibility of probing the degenerate scalar dark sector using a forward muon facility at a future muon collider.

Result: The results suggest that future muon colliders with forward muon facilities could provide a promising avenue for studying the inert scalar doublet model and its dark matter implications.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a forward muon facility at a future muon collider holds potential for uncovering the elusive degenerate dark sector within the IDM framework.

Abstract: The Inert scalar Doublet Model (IDM) presents a simple yet elegant framework
for a scalar dark sector where the lightest mode functions as a viable dark
matter candidate under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. With TeV-scale particles
accessible to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or future colliders, probing
different dark matter scenarios within IDM provides an exciting opportunity.
While the Higgs portal dark matter scenario is extensively well-studied at the
LHC, probing the degenerate scalar dark sector presents some unique challenges,
not only in detecting excessively soft decay products and the tiny production
cross-section expected at the higher masses. The present study explores the
potential of a forward muon facility at a future muon collider to uncover this
elusive degenerate dark sector.

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，这种全新的完全自动化的介子部分子淋浴算法在与现有LHC数据的对比中表现出更好的一致性，并将在Herwig-7.4.0发布后公开使用。

Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully automated quarkonium parton shower
in Herwig 7, based on non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorisation with
spin-colour projections. The framework systematically incorporates
colour-singlet and colour-octet production mechanisms, gluon fragmentation, and
diquark production processes. Perturbative short-distance coefficients are
combined with non-perturbative NRQCD matrix elements to simulate heavy-quark
bound state formation. Splitting functions for $S$-, $P$- and $D$-wave states
are explicitly derived and integrated into the angular-ordered shower
evolution. The implementation preserves spin correlations and polarisation
effects while accurately accounting for feed-down contributions. Results
demonstrate improved agreement with the existing LHC data. This quarkonium
parton shower will become publicly available with the release of Herwig-7.4.0.

### [57] [$b \to c$ semileptonic sum rule: Current status and prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06322)
*Motoi Endo,Syuhei Iguro,Satoshi Mishima,Ryoutaro Watanabe*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the validity of sum rules for semileptonic decay rates, showing their utility for experimental consistency checks and testing Standard Model predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the relations between the decay rates of specific semileptonic decays and to test the validity of Standard Model predictions.

Method: The authors revisit the derivation of the sum rule for total decay rates starting from the heavy quark and zero-recoil limits, and they examine deviations from these limits.

Result: Deviations and corrections are found to be negligible compared to current experimental uncertainties.

Conclusion: The sum rule is useful for cross-checking experimental consistency and testing the validity of Standard Model predictions.

Abstract: The $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules provide relations between the decay
rates of $B \to D^{(*)} \tau\bar\nu$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu$.
Starting from the heavy quark and zero-recoil limits, we revisit the derivation
of the sum rule for total decay rates. We then examine deviations from the
limits and investigate corrections arising from realistic hadron masses and
higher-order contributions to form factors, taking account of uncertainties. We
show that these corrections are negligible compared to current experimental
uncertainties, indicating that the sum rule is useful for cross-checking
experimental consistency and testing the validity of the Standard Model
predictions. In future, precise determinations of the form factors particularly
for the tensor operator will be necessary to compare the sum rule predictions
with $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu$ data from the LHCb experiment and
the Tera-Z projects.

Abstract: We discuss the central exclusive photoproduction of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs in
photon-proton and in proton-proton collisions at high energies. The $\rho^{0}$,
$\omega$, $f_{2}(1270)$, and non-resonant (Drell-S\"oding) contributions are
considered. The calculation is based on the tensor-pomeron model that includes
not only the dominant pomeron exchange but also reggeon and odderon exchanges.
In the Drell-S\"oding contribution we have different subenergies for the
$\pi^{+}p$ and $\pi^{-}p$ systems. In the method which we propose now we take
this into account. Respecting the gauge-invariance constraints is then a
nontrivial problem for which, however, we present a solution here. In this way
we improve the corresponding calculations presented in JHEP 01, 151 (2015) and
in Phys. Rev. D 91, 074023 (2015). The revised model leads to enhanced cross
sections and gives an increased skewing of the $\rho^{0}$ spectral shape. For
the $pp\to pp\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction, we calculate differential cross sections
as function of the two-pion invariant mass, pion transverse momentum and pion
pseudorapidity. Predictions of proton-pion and proton-pion-pion invariant mass
distributions and the distribution in the proton-proton four-momentum transfer
squared are also presented. This research is relevant in the context of ALICE,
ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb measurements in $pp$ collisions, even when the leading
protons are not detected and instead only rapidity-gap conditions are checked
experimentally. Our results can also serve as basis for the description of
coherent $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ production in ultra-peripheral $p$A and AA collisions
at the LHC. The formulas given in our paper can directly be used for the
analysis of photoproduction and small-$Q^{2}$ electroproduction in $ep$
collisions at high energies. Such data exist from the HERA experiments and will
be obtained in the future at the electron-ion colliders.

TL;DR: 本研究探討內稟奇異性對大氣緲子與中微子通量的影響，發現其可提升介子與重子產量，但預測結果尚無法完全符合IceCube實驗觀測與限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IceCube實驗觀測到高能緲子通量增加與中微子通量上限，需評估內稟奇異性對大氣緲子與中微子通量的影響。

Method: 採用Regge模型計算內稟奇異性產生的介子與重子，並使用MCEq程式模擬高能宇宙線與大氣交互作用產生的輕子通量。

Result: 內稟奇異性會增加D介子與Λ_c重子的產量，導致緲子與中微子通量上升，但目前模型預測與IceCube實驗數據間仍存在差異。

Conclusion: 研究发现内禀奇異性可以增加前向產生的介子與奇異重子，進而影響宇宙線中微子通量，但同時符合IceCube實驗的上下限限制仍存在挑戰。

Abstract: The all-sky very-high energy ($10^4-10^6$ GeV) atmospheric muon flux is most
recently measured by IceCube, where in the higher energy range, the spectrum
hardens indicating a prompt component. IceCube also measures the atmospheric
muon neutrino flux at high energy. Since this is dominated by the astrophysical
flux, they are only able to set an upper bound on the prompt atmospheric muon
neutrino flux contribution. We provide a new evaluation of the prompt
atmospheric muon flux including for the first time an intrinsic charm component
to colliding nucleons. This increases forward production of $\bar{D}^{0}$,
$D^-$ and $\Lambda_c$ which decay into final states that can contain muons and
muon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to
intrinsic charm has an associated increase in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We
consider the Regge ansatz for intrinsic charm production that we implement in
MCEq used for the calculation of the lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges
of obtaining predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's
high energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and their upper bound on the
prompt muon neutrino flux. We quantify the discrepancies.
