The full FDM dynamics are\nimplemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation\nof the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM\nhalos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic\nreionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark\nmatter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm\npower spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a\ncorrect FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when\nX-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters\nfrom upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area).

Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over\ntime will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range.\nMoreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments\nhave shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral\nline broadening.

YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from\nGemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA),\nand new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission\nof H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with\nexcitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed\nambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found.\nThe ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular\noutflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular\nfeature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum\nemission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of\nwhich stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition.\nFrom the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a\nlikely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at\n~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core.

Despite its cluster-like compactness, its\ninferred dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_dyn/L) suggests a dark\nmatter-dominated nature, prompting interpretations of UMa3/U1 as a microgalaxy,\nthough current measurements remain inconclusive. Thousand-level M_dyn/L values\nare not unique to galaxies; self-gravitating dark star clusters (DSCs) can\nreach comparable levels via energy injection driven by a centrally segregated\nblack hole subsystem (BHSub), which accelerates the evaporation of luminous\nstars and leads to a super-virial appearance with elevated velocity dispersion.\nTo assess whether UMa3/U1 is a DSC, we conducted direct N-body simulations and\nidentified a model that successfully reproduces both its compact structure and\nelevated M_dyn/L, supporting a self-gravitating cluster origin. We find the\ncluster entered the DSC phase around 4 Gyr ago, with its luminous stars\nexpected to be depleted within the next 1 Gyr, followed by the gradual\ndisruption of the central BHSub over the subsequent Gyr.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain\nvaluable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark\nmatter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark\nmatter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM)\non the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum\nand the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are\nimplemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation\nof the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM\nhalos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic\nreionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark\nmatter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm\npower spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a\ncorrect FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when\nX-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters\nfrom upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In\nFDM cosmologies with $m_\\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to\nconstrain the boson mass to within $\\sim10$% at 2$\\sigma$ confidence with a\nmock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent.\nHowever, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate\nwith the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson\nmass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone."}
