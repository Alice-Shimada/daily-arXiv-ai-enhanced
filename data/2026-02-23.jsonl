If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected."}

Comparing with a set of satellite trails identified by eye, we find a trail recovery rate of 85\\% and a false detection rate (after removing diffraction spikes that are easily filtered) of 2.5\\%. By performing an analysis using a much larger ACS/WFC data set where false trails are identified by their persistence across multiple images of the same field, we identify the Radon Transform parameter space and image properties where our algorithm is unreliable, and estimate a false detection rate of $\\sim10\\%$ elsewhere. We apply our method to ACS/WFC data taken between 2002 and 2022 to determine both the frequency of satellite trail contamination in science data and also the typical trail brightness as a function of time. We find the rate of satellite trail contamination has increased by approximately a factor of two in the last two decades, but there is no clear systematic evolution in the typical trail brightness.

Using Zwicky Transient Facility alerts as a proxy for Rubin, we demonstrate the system in use in cases where Euclid did and did not detect the transient and highlight the value that can be added in each case. For transients detected by Euclid these benefits include identifying the supernovae (SNe) in observations taken prior to ground-based detection, thereby better constraining the explosion time, such as SN 2024pvw detected ~3 d prior to ground based detections.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, half-mass densities $ρ_{\\rm h}=100 - 10^5\\,\\rm M_\\odot\\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters.

We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $ρ_{\\rm h}<500\\,\\rm M_\\odot\\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\\rm rh}>1.3\\,\\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*>330\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*<300\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime."}

Using the geometric prescription that identifies the time derivative of the complexity with the proper momentum of a massive probe, we analyse radial geodesics in several top-down gravity duals exhibiting confinement and a mass gap. In all geometries with a smooth infrared end-of-space we uncover a robust and universal qualitative feature: Krylov complexity exhibits oscillatory behaviour. The oscillation frequency is controlled by the confinement scale, while the amplitude depends on both the ultraviolet cutoff and the infrared scale. Additional conserved charges modify these patterns without altering their qualitative structure. We further compare our results with the Krylov complexity of the longitudinally perturbed Ising model. The qualitative agreement suggests that oscillatory behaviour of Krylov complexity constitutes a universal signature of confinement and provides a sensitive probe of infrared reorganisation in strongly coupled quantum field theories."}

We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available."}

Locality in the chains both generates the hierarchical Standard Model Yukawa matrices, and ensures that CP and flavor violating effects are small, even with the vector-like particles at the TeV scale. A simple extension also generates neutrino masses, whose tiny size is parametrically related to the square of the electron Yukawa coupling. We outline the essential features of these models, explain how fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles emerge, and explore their phenomenological implications. This framework can be tested both in the final run of the LHC as well as at possible future colliders operating at the 10 TeV scale, and we identify some of the distinctive experimental signatures associated with the production and decay of the new vector-like fermions."}

LISA's interferometers must deliver pm/rtHz sensitivity while accommodating beam tilts up to 1 mrad at the photodiodes, which degrade the interferometric amplitude and increase the induced readout noise coupling. This paper uses an analytical framework developed by the authors in a previous work, based on minimal and justified approximations, that relates beam tilt to the resulting heterodyne signal amplitude in a generic two-beam interferometer with circular-area photodiodes (PDs). A set of interferometric topologies is analyzed, all of high relevance for LISA. We derive the exact amplitude response for an infinite detector and a closed-form approximation for finite detectors, and we validate both against numerical simulations and experimental measurements on an ultra-stable LISA-representative testbed. We then use this model to quantify the phase-noise amplification arising from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under tilt, showing that curvature mismatches between the interfering beams substantially enhance this effect. Finally, we introduce a compact function that captures the angular dependence of correlated and uncorrelated phase noises in quadrant photodiode (QPD)-based readouts. Here, a new noise feature, caused by wavefront curvature mismatch, is predicted and measured for the first time. These results indicate that controlling wavefront curvature mismatch in the test mass interferometer (TMI) is essential to limit excess phase noise. The models and results derived in this paper, although originating in the context of LISA, are general and can be applied to any interferometric topology undergoing tilts with pivot on the detector plane."}

This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm.

This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations."}

Whether such smooth time-warp distortions are observable depends jointly on deformation strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yet this relationship has not been quantified in a template-free framework. We study the detectability of these distortions using time-frequency representations derived from the continuous wavelet transform. Instead of reconstruction error alone, we examine trajectory-based statistics, in particular the evolution of the power-weighted frequency centroid. We find that environmental modulation can be detected using a single-sample statistic referenced to an isolated-binary distribution, without requiring matched templates. Across a grid of cumulative phase distortions and SNR, detection performance collapses onto a single scaling parameter defined as the product of phase distortion and SNR. The ROC-AUC follows a sigmoid transition in this parameter. Moderate distortions are detectable at low SNR, whereas smaller distortions require higher SNR. These results indicate that smooth environmental phase modulation is not generically absorbed by intrinsic waveform variability; instead, detectability is governed by a simple scaling between cumulative phase distortion and signal strength."}

If no signals are found, would minimal dark matter be excluded? Yes for the simplest models, but it has been unknown for the important extension of two multiplets coupled by Higgs interactions (Higgs-coupled minimal dark matter). We present a generalized framework for calculating nonperturbative effects for such models that also covers the case of individual multiplets. In this framework, we calculate nonperturbative effects on freezeout as well as the prospects for direct detection, correcting shortcomings and omissions in the literature. Importantly, for the mixed Majorana (odd) and Dirac (even) multiplet combinations 3M2D, 5M4D, and 7M6D, we find that the predicted direct-detection signals can extend below the neutrino floor. Fully testing minimal dark matter will thus require more than direct-detection experiments."}

As part of the Colombian Antarctic Telescopes for 21 cm Absorption during Reionization (CANTAR) initiative, we present a simulation and analysis framework to evaluate antenna chromaticity, optimize instrument design, and assess site suitability for global 21 cm experiments. Using frequency-dependent beam models and Haslam-based sky maps, we compute dynamic spectra for the EDGES blade dipole and a set of dipole and novel monopole antennas optimized via particle swarm optimization. The optimized designs exhibit improved spectral smoothness compared to EDGES, particularly in the 70-120 MHz range. We also evaluate latitude-dependent sky brightness and identify mid-latitude sites (-40° to +5°) as optimal for foreground suppression. We apply Bayesian inference together with posterior predictive model validation to the publicly released EDGES data, assessing statistical consistency rather than hypothesis testing or model comparison. We find that physically motivated foreground and ionospheric models are statistically consistent with the data only when a 21 cm absorption feature is excluded. From the validated posterior, we generate a statistically validated ensemble of foreground corrections for use in beam-sky simulations. These results support a two-phase strategy for CANTAR: Antarctic deployments for calibration and testing, and future science operations at mid-latitude sites. Our framework provides a validated path toward robust foreground modeling, antenna design, and systematics control for global 21 cm signal detection."}

At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model."}

We analytically derive the conditions for stability, determine the equilibrium radius and the corresponding minimum asymptotic energy, and show that small perturbations about this equilibrium lead to a stable oscillatory motion of the shell. The oscillation frequency is obtained explicitly and shown to increase with the shell mass and decrease with the charge of the central object. When the shell itself carries charge, its stability depends on the sign of this charge. Shells with the same sign as the central charge become progressively less stable, while oppositely charged shells exhibit enhanced stability due to the electrostatic attraction. These findings highlight the stabilizing role of electromagnetic interactions in Dyson-type thin-shell configurations within general relativity."}

We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $χ$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV.

The factorization formulae of the vacuum-to-$Λ_b$ correlation function, constructed from the interpolating current for the proton, are derived at leading power in $m_p / m_{Λ_b}$, using the method of regions. With our specific choice of interpolating current, only the twist-4 distribution amplitude of the $Λ_b$ baryon contributes to the form factors.

Whether such smooth time-warp distortions are observable depends jointly on deformation strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yet this relationship has not been quantified in a template-free framework. We study the detectability of these distortions using time-frequency representations derived from the continuous wavelet transform. Instead of reconstruction error alone, we examine trajectory-based statistics, in particular the evolution of the power-weighted frequency centroid. We find that environmental modulation can be detected using a single-sample statistic referenced to an isolated-binary distribution, without requiring matched templates. Across a grid of cumulative phase distortions and SNR, detection performance collapses onto a single scaling parameter defined as the product of phase distortion and SNR. The ROC-AUC follows a sigmoid transition in this parameter. Moderate distortions are detectable at low SNR, whereas smaller distortions require higher SNR. These results indicate that smooth environmental phase modulation is not generically absorbed by intrinsic waveform variability; instead, detectability is governed by a simple scaling between cumulative phase distortion and signal strength."}

Using the on-shell scheme the parameters in the scalar sector can be fixed and expressed in terms of observed meson masses and decay constants. The remaining parameters can be varied. In the QMD models, all the symmetries are global, including the $SU(N_c)$ symmetry. The breaking of the global symmetries gives rise to a number of Goldstone bosons depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern, i.e. whether the system is in the 2SC phase or the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. This is in contrast to perturbative QCD, where some of the gauge bosons become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We classify the Goldstone bosons and show that their type and number are in accordance with general counting rules. The thermodynamic potential $Ω$ is calculated in the mean-field approximation, where we include quark loops, while mesons and diquarks are treated at tree level. As important applications, we study the properties of the pion-condensed phase at finite isospin chemical potential, and the 2SC and CFL phases at finite baryon chemical potential.

For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes."}

The radiation- and matter-dominated critical points are found to possess a saddle character in phase space, ensuring their transient nature and enabling the cosmological evolution to naturally progress toward a stable late-time accelerated attractor.

In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{χ-ν} \\lesssim {\\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits. Finally, when employing the logarithmic flat prior for $u^0_{χ-ν}$, we have shown hints to a nonzero interaction at $95\\%$ CL by combining Planck, DESI and ACT data."}

The magnitude of rotation is relevant to estimating the total mass of UMa III/U1, which is critical in determining whether or not UMa III/U1 is in fact a UFD, or possibly a star cluster home to a significant binary fraction. A non-rotating model and a rotational model are fitted for the current total population of member stars of UMa III/U1, finding that a non-rotating model was preferred by a factor of $\\sim 5-12 \\times$. This was repeated on a reduced population of UMa III/U1, where potential contaminant stars were removed. A similar preference for non-rotation was found for these reduced populations. We calculate a lower-bound rotational mass estimate for UMa III/U1 and a corresponding lower bound mass-to-light ratio of $ 734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} \\mathrm{M_\\odot} / \\mathrm{L_\\odot} $ for the total population.

We show that a finite and regulator-independent definition follows from the on-shell action of conformal gravity in four and six dimensions, implemented through the replica construction.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Minimal electroweak dark matter models are compelling due to their simplicity, though calculations of their freezeout abundance are complicated by nonperturbative effects due to Sommerfeld enhancement and bound-state formation. It has been shown that all individual multiplet scenarios beyond the doublet lead to direct-detection signals above the neutrino floor and thus within the reach of next-generation experiments. If no signals are found, would minimal dark matter be excluded? Yes for the simplest models, but it has been unknown for the important extension of two multiplets coupled by Higgs interactions (Higgs-coupled minimal dark matter). We present a generalized framework for calculating nonperturbative effects for such models that also covers the case of individual multiplets. In this framework, we calculate nonperturbative effects on freezeout as well as the prospects for direct detection, correcting shortcomings and omissions in the literature. Importantly, for the mixed Majorana (odd) and Dirac (even) multiplet combinations 3M2D, 5M4D, and 7M6D, we find that the predicted direct-detection signals can extend below the neutrino floor. Fully testing minimal dark matter will thus require more than direct-detection experiments."}

The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies."}

The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\\rm R, \\star}=2433\\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\\rm R,HI}=2423\\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\\rm GC}/M_\\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs."}

While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored."}

We also find that when the $χ_1$ relic density matches observation direct and indirect searches are not kinematically accessible.

However, the presence of anomalous couplings suggests the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this study, we focus on the sensitivities of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs), specially the dimension-8 operators associated with field-strength tensor structures within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, at future Muon Colliders. Our analysis targets the neutral aQGC-sensitive processes $μ^{+}μ^{-} \\to μ^+ γγμ^-$ and $μ^{+} μ^{-} \\to μ^+ Z γμ^-$, simulated at center-of-mass energies of 3 TeV and 10 TeV. Signal and background events are generated using {\\sc MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO}, interfaced with Pythia8 for parton showering and hadronization, and Delphes for fast detector simulation. A multivariate analysis based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) is employed to enhance signal-to-background discrimination, utilizing a comprehensive set of kinematic and reconstructed observables from the final-state particles. Unitarity is preserved through the application of an energy-dependent clipping procedure within the EFT validity regime. Our findings indicate that future muon colliders offer significant sensitivity improvements over current experimental constraints on aQGCs. Furthermore, a comparison with other future collider scenarios shows that the 10 TeV Muon Collider, even with a 10\\% systematic uncertainty, provides substantially stronger projected limits at 95\\% confidence level than those currently reported by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC as well as projected limits by future hadron colliders. These results underscore the enhanced potential of high-energy muon collider to probe new physics in the electroweak sector through precision measurements of aQGCs."}

We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff > 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data. This work demonstrates the utility of HI observations for finding and characterizing the low surface brightness Universe."}

We show that the factorisation of one-loop leading singularities of a null Wilson loop's expectation value into a product of tree-level objects is manifest at the level of twistor Wilson loop diagrams, and is a simple consequence of planarity, without appeal to e.g. unitarity on the amplitude side of the duality. We then use the same approach to derive compact formulae for the one-loop leading singularities of correlators of multiple light-like Wilson loop operators in terms of tree-level objects.

Utilizing recent numerical analyses of central configurations--special equilibrium solutions to the Newtonian $N$-body problem--we uncover systematic spatial variations in nearest-neighbor particle separations correlated with the radial distance from the system's center of mass. We argue that these variations reflect a context-dependent, emergent effective geometry shaped by gravitational interactions, in accordance with Poincaré's assertion that measured geometry depends on the forces influencing measuring devices, and Einstein's view that rods and clocks define physical geometry through their local dynamics. By revisiting these foundational insights within a modern computational framework, we provide evidence that geometry in self-gravitating Newtonian systems is not a fixed background, but an emergent construct arising from internal physical interactions."}

However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE."}

Using the on-shell scheme the parameters in the scalar sector can be fixed and expressed in terms of observed meson masses and decay constants. The remaining parameters can be varied. In the QMD models, all the symmetries are global, including the $SU(N_c)$ symmetry. The breaking of the global symmetries gives rise to a number of Goldstone bosons depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern, i.e. whether the system is in the 2SC phase or the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. This is in contrast to perturbative QCD, where some of the gauge bosons become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We classify the Goldstone bosons and show that their type and number are in accordance with general counting rules. The thermodynamic potential $Ω$ is calculated in the mean-field approximation, where we include quark loops, while mesons and diquarks are treated at tree level. As important applications, we study the properties of the pion-condensed phase at finite isospin chemical potential, and the 2SC and CFL phases at finite baryon chemical potential. We present a few numerical results focusing on the speed of sound, gaps, and condensates. It is shown that the BCS gaps approaches a constant for large isospin and baryon chemical potentials and that the speed of sound approaches the conformal value from above in the same limit."}

As a first application, we simulate the gravitational collapse of a uniformly rotating, magnetized neutron star, demonstrating stable radiation evolution through apparent-horizon formation using a novel excision technique based on the tapering of state vector evolution inside the horizon.

Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $Δ$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%.

We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available."}

Locality in the chains both generates the hierarchical Standard Model Yukawa matrices, and ensures that CP and flavor violating effects are small, even with the vector-like particles at the TeV scale. A simple extension also generates neutrino masses, whose tiny size is parametrically related to the square of the electron Yukawa coupling. We outline the essential features of these models, explain how fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles emerge, and explore their phenomenological implications. This framework can be tested both in the final run of the LHC as well as at possible future colliders operating at the 10 TeV scale, and we identify some of the distinctive experimental signatures associated with the production and decay of the new vector-like fermions."}

The extended Lagrangian of the model contains a new constructive element, which is based on the covariant SU(N) symmetric divergence of the multiplet of vector fields; this new element, being the multiplet of scalars from the point of view of spacetime transformations and the color vector from the point of view of the SU(N) group space, gives us the possibility to formulate properly the multi-axionic extension of the Peccei-Quinn theory. The hypothesis of a spontaneous polarization of the multi-axionic color aether in the early Universe is presented. The set of self-consistent master equations of the model is derived.

The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $Λ$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7<z<1.8$ with a catalog of $\\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events.

We implement a self-consistent treatment of the sterile-neutrino free streaming and the active-neutrino self-interactions on structure formation, which yield a unique scale-dependent modification to the linear matter power spectrum. We then set bounds on this scenario using a combination of the cosmic microwave background and Ly$α$ forest constraints. Specifically, we utilize the two recent likelihoods derived from eBOSS data: (i) an effective field theory (EFT) based full-shape likelihood and (ii) a compressed likelihood obtained from the PRIYA-simulation emulator. We produce some of the most stringent observational constraints to date on sterile neutrino DM, comparable to the bounds from the most stringent laboratory constraints."}

Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries."}

Then, we introduce a method to transparently cross-check their convergence, using both quantized energy levels in the box and infinite-volume phase shifts for the same potential. We clarify how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism and show in detail how the quantization conditions converge order by order in the various irreducible representations.

This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics."}

We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra. By using the latest CMB and BAO datasets from Planck, DESI and ACT, the constraint on today's DM-neutrino interaction parameter for the normal neutrino mass ordering reaches $u^0_{χ-ν} \\lesssim {\\cal O}(10^{-13})$, nearly nine orders stronger than that for temperature-independent case in the literature. This can be understood by noting that the scattering cross section increases nearly quadratically with cosmological temperature in the early universe, leading to enhanced effects.

In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{χ-ν} \\lesssim {\\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits.

At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model."}
