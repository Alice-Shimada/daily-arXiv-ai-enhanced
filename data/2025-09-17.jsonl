Six dissipative scenarios are\nconsidered, incorporating the emission of particles that may be either massless\nor possess a kinematically allowed light mass. Both short-range and long-range\nforce-mediated dSIDM interactions are examined. In the non-relativistic regime\nwe obtain closed-form expressions of the energy-differential cross sections by\na controlled expansion in the initial relative dark matter velocity. Up to\ntrivial factors, the leading-order squared emission amplitude is\nmodel-independent for massless emissions. Model dependence arises for massive\nparticle emission and at the next-to-leading order. The latter reduces to three\ndistinct cases. The derived analytical expressions for dipole and quadrupole\nemission exhibit excellent agreement with numerical computations, providing\nsimple, ready-to-use formulas. These expressions are benchmarked against full\nnumerical results to confirm their accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the\nbehavior of these processes in the soft emission limit.

Implications for high and low redshift massive black holes", "comment": "Submitted to A&A. 9 Figures", "summary": "Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive\nblack holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their\nbirthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas\nand merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center\nformation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black\nhole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the\n$\\texttt{L-Galaxies}{\\it BH}$ semi-analytical model, which includes multiple\nseed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most\nsignificant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the\nmodel to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the\ngalactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that\nseed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact\non the MBH population at $z<1$, but causes significant differences at higher\nredshifts. Particularly, the abundance of $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ MBHs at $z>4$ can be\nup to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar\nluminosity functions with $\\rm L_{bol}>10^{44} \\rm erg/s$ are similarly\naffected, although they still align with observational constraints. The\noff-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At $z>5$, the\namplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed\nmodels. These differences fade by $z \\sim 2$ for galaxies $>10^{11} M_{\\odot}$,\nand by $z=0$ for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population\nrecently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can\nform independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs\nwithin LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a\nsuppression of events at high-$z$ and an enhancement at low-$z$."}

This fact has been\nverified in a number of scenarios, that involve tides of bosonic fields of\nvarious natures (e.g. scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational), and has\ntriggered active research in trying to identify the underlying reason.\nSurprisingly, two counterexamples have been found recently. The first, concerns\ncharged-field tides on electrically-charged black holes. In that case, however,\nthe response cannot be disentangled from dissipative effects, and might thus be\nargued to not consist of a truly conservative deformation. The second concerns\nfermionic tides on neutral holes. While these yield a purely conservative\nresponse, they lack a classical interpretation, which is the physical regime\nwhere black hole deformability is understood. Here, we consider magnetic\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes and show that electrically-charged, scalar-field\ntides induce non-vanishing tidal Love numbers. We prove that this is a purely\nnon-dissipative effect, in contrast to the cases of rotating or\nelectrically-charged black holes, and hence consists of a genuine deformation.\nIn addition, the magnetic charge resolves common ambiguities in defining Love\nnumbers, so our result does not rely on any regularisation scheme. This\nconstitutes a clear realisation of how new physics can influence black hole\ntidal deformability, and offers new perspectives on the study of black hole\nLove numbers."}

To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the\nREACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time.\nFitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data\ndemonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time\nbut leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions\non the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load,\nreducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration\nequation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic\nresidual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06%\nof the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation\nsource compared with previous calibration methods.

In this work, we examine how prior choices affect\nsuch conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary\nuse of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$\nand $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we\nconstruct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF),\ntrained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the\ndistribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find\nthat the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can\nbe reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed\npriors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with\n$\\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type\nIa supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken\ntogether, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises\nbecause uniform priors - often mischaracterized as \"uninformative\" - can\nactually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our\nresults underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to\nensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new\nhypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based\nframework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains,\nrequiring $\\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base\nanalysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the\nscalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models."}

Furthermore, comparing the\nbeam-crossing test results with those obtained during the first two BepiColombo\nsuperior solar conjunction experiments highlights a potential application of\nthis technique during periods of solar conjunction. However, technical\nchallenges, adverse weather, and limited Ka-band transponder use, reduced the\nnumber of analyzed tracking passes. Future studies should therefore expand the\ndataset to consolidate the results. Furthermore new theoretical studies and\ntest campaigns should elaborate on the selection process for the optimal\ncrossing height."}

Chemistry in those dust/ice mixtures is determined by diffusion\nand reaction of molecules and radicals. However, investigations of diffusion of\nastrophysically relevant radicals and molecules across the surface and through\nthe pores of cosmic dust grains and of surface reactions consequent to such\ndiffusion is largely uncharted territory. This paper presents results of a\nstudy of a solid-state reaction of two molecular species, CO2 and NH3,\nseparated by a layer of porous silicate grain aggregates, analogues of cosmic\ndust. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of the dust layer was\nnecessary for a pure thermal CO2 + 2NH3 reaction to proceed, leading to the\nformation of ammonium carbamate (NH4+NH2COO-), an ionic solid containing a\ncomplex organic moiety of prebiotic interest recently detected in a\nprotoplanetary disk. This result speaks for: (i) efficient diffusion of\nmolecules on/within cosmic dust, (ii) an underestimated role for surface\ncatalysis in the astrochemistry of cosmic dust, and (iii) potentially efficient\ndust-promoted chemistry in warm cosmic environments, such as protostellar\nenvelopes and protoplanetary disks."}

GW data\nis challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source\nproperties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need\nfor robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the\ndevelopment of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural\nnetworks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs\nsimulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then\nextended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to\ndistinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are\nevaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing\nit against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably\ndistinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies\nabove 98\\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind\ndataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude,\nhighlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can\npotentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are\npreparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes."}

In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection\ncapabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline),\nresponsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this,\nwe inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the\nVIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock\ndwarf galaxies are generated with simple S\\'ersic models and structural\nparameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To\ncharacterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the\neffective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve\ncompletenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28]. These\nnumbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion\nwith background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into\naccount those effects, they become respectively 86 % and 38 %. The MER pipeline\nperforms a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to\na flux loss for galaxies with Re > 10\". By using the final MER mosaics and\nreinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover\nreliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This\nbackground-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe\ndwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other\ndeep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key\nissue in LSB science."}

The mock\ndwarf galaxies are generated with simple S\\'ersic models and structural\nparameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To\ncharacterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the\neffective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve\ncompletenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28].

Moreover, we assume that the early Universe can be\ndescribed with fewer initial symmetries, thus we abandon the isotropy\nassumption and instead explore anisotropic universes, beginning with the\nsimplest one, namely Bianchi I (BI). The presence of small initial fluctuations\nin the early universe can be well described by perturbations around a\nhomogeneous background. GR is a constrained system, and we apply the so-called\nDirac procedure for constrained systems to derive a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian\nformulation suitable for quantization. In this work, we present how this\nprocedure can be extended to a generic background and its relation to the\nKuchar decomposition. Subsequently, we apply this formulation to a BI universe,\nobtaining new and interesting results on the gauge-invariant representation of\nmatter and geometry perturbations. Contrary to the FLRW case, in which all the\nmodes decouple, in BI we see that scalar and tensor modes do not decouple. We\nshow that new types of gauge-fixing conditions exit in this case. For instance,\na gravitational wave can be encoded into scalar modes, by introducing a new\ngauge which is not valid in FLRW. Furthermore, we make a first step towards a\nconsistent and unified quantization of the composite system made of a\nbackground mode and perturbation modes. Specifically, we study tensor modes in\na FLRW universe. We focus on the relation between the choice of internal time\nof the universe and the quantum evolution it undergoes. Our results indicate\nthat the time reparametrization invariance in general relativity affects the\nquantum evolution of the background and perturbation modes.

This work\npresents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that\nleverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and\nwavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the\nvariability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a\nparametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\\tau$) and asymptotic\namplitude of the variability (SF$_\\infty$) based on the redshift, the\nrest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based\nphoto-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW\nparameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift\n(VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the\nredshift estimates from SED fitting.\n  Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating\nsignificant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison\nwith SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision.

The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent\nabsorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO),\nmarking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our\nGalaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some\nobjects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices -- never before observed beyond the\nMilky Way (MW) -- and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column\ndensities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive\nprotostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice\ncolumn densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more\nmassive objects (~1x10^{17} cm-2 for water and ~1x10^{16} cm-2 for CO2 and CO).\nHowever, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ\nfrom those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not\nsignificantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded\nby the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is\nlikely impervious to the radiation environment."}

As the energy density redshifts down to the potential\nscale, a nonlinear transition occurs, during which the axion's adiabatic\ninvariant is not conserved. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of axion\ndark matter by incorporating the effects of this nonlinear transition through a\nprecise study of the axion spectrum. We demonstrate that in the parameter\nregion with a relatively small decay constant, often favored in axion search\nexperiments, special care is required when estimating the axion abundance and\nspectrum. We also highlight a scenario in which axions are produced through the\nstimulated decay of a modulus, a situation that may naturally arise in the\nstring axiverse, where the nonlinear transition occurs across a wide parameter\nregion. Furthermore, we discuss related phenomena, including QCD axion dark\nmatter, the formation of axion clumps such as miniclusters and axion stars,\ngravitational wave production, and formation of primordial black holes as dark\nmatter."}

Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions\nof new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).

The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic\nfollow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most\nstudies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are\ntraditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work\npresents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that\nleverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and\nwavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the\nvariability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a\nparametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\\tau$) and asymptotic\namplitude of the variability (SF$_\\infty$) based on the redshift, the\nrest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based\nphoto-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW\nparameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift\n(VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the\nredshift estimates from SED fitting.\n  Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating\nsignificant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison\nwith SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision.

Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary\nuse of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$\nand $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we\nconstruct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF),\ntrained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the\ndistribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find\nthat the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can\nbe reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed\npriors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with\n$\\Lambda$CDM.

The\nbreakdown of the approximate SU(3)\\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\\times\nU(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\\sim 10 TeV results in a set of\npseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs\ndoublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is\ndiscussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z_2 symmetry may give rise to\ntiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with\nmasses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the\nCHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the\nHiggs doublet and these composite fermions."}

To assess correctness,\nwe introduce a new diagnostic based on the configurational temperature (or\nconfigurational coupling) estimator, recently proposed as a thermodynamic\nconsistency check. We compare this criterion with the established\nNagata-Nishimura-Shimasaki drift-decay test across a range of couplings and\nchemical potentials. Our results show that complex Langevin dynamics yields\nreliable results in the ordered phase (large $\\beta$), but fails in the\ndisordered phase (small $\\beta$), even when the sign problem is mild. The\nconfigurational estimator provides a clear and physics-driven reliability test\nthat complements drift-based diagnostics. These findings establish the\nestimator as a practical tool for identifying incorrect convergence, and\nhighlight its potential for broader applications in lattice field theories with\ncomplex actions."}
