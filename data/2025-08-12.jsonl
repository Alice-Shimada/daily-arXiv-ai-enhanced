The standard approach to\nretrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from\nbright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,\nin contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants\nexhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to\nseparate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from\nthese contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our\nability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are\nincoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent\nexcess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this\npaper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process\nregression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them\nfrom the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of\nobservation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic\nsignals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric\nvisibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes\ncontaining foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The\nsimulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract\nincoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over\nstandard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the\ncontaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal.

We further test the method using\nnumerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show\nthat missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent\nviolations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for\nanalysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real\ngravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We\npresent joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3,\nfinding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is\n$0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in\nthe FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results\nhighlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and\ndemonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the\nfourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA."}

The standard approach to\nretrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from\nbright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,\nin contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants\nexhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to\nseparate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from\nthese contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our\nability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are\nincoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent\nexcess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this\npaper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process\nregression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them\nfrom the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of\nobservation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic\nsignals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric\nvisibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes\ncontaining foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The\nsimulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract\nincoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over\nstandard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the\ncontaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a\nvariety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can\nsubtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing\nthe 21-cm signal."}

We demonstrate that,\nunlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\\leq 4$ are not\naffected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters,\nemphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses.

It is not easy to develop a\ncoherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard\nGeneral Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of\nthe very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm\nbasis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which\nInflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\\,$ this, of course, includes the\nvast majority of such theories -- $\\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that\nspacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is\ncompletely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the\n``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be\nconfirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from\nthe outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly\nmetric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far\nthe most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm\npredictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the\ndegree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component\nof the Hubble tension."}

We also examine the $r$-dependence,\nfinding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field\nenhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for\nneutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG)\nmodel show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear\ndeviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide\nuseful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in\nstrong magnetic fields at finite baryon density."}

We study GW production\nin a compelling scenario where a rotating axion(-like) field becomes relevant\nfor a brief period in the early universe before transitioning into a kination\nfluid and rapidly dissipating its energy through cosmic expansion. During this\nshort epoch, the curvature perturbation can be predominantly sourced by the\nrotating axion and may significantly exceed the adiabatic component. Moreover,\naxion field perturbations grow on superhorizon scales during this phase. These\neffects can generate a strong stochastic background of induced GWs. This GW\nbackground also exhibits a pronounced large-scale anisotropy inherited from the\naxion fluctuations, serving as a distinctive signature of the scenario.\nImportantly, the transient nature of axion relevance enables this scenario to\nevade stringent bounds on large-scale perturbations. We analyze various\nobservational constraints and find that both the amplitude and anisotropy of\nthe resulting GW signal could be accessible to future detectors."}

Quantum processes of\nquantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their\ntemperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of\nentropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area\nof the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations;\n(ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state,\nobtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of\nentropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson\ndistribution."}
