However, the small PSF\nsize provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making\nit difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions\nunusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each\nexposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4\narcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF\nexhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed.\nAdditionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the\nfilters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no\nsignificant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time\n(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212\n(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS.

To address this question, we adopt a statistical\napproach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all\nknown constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics\n(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given\nEOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of\nthe sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture\nfor a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.\nHowever, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that\nit is true in general.

Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four\nknown companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows\nthat at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space\nwhere inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to\nexist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white\ndwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in\npost-main-sequence exoplanets."}

We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM.

The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%.

Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength).

Assuming PBHs as\ndark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their\nlensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced\neffects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying\nthe PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass\npredominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the\nspectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced\ndeviation.

While the\nwidely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for\ntheir formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely\nunderstood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in\nisolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the\nso-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness.\nHowever, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body\nmodels of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random\nmotions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo,\nwe explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing\nbar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both\nprograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short\ntimescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for\nmoderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to\naccelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo\nspin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence.

Variations in gas\nexpulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity\ndistribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which\ngoverns both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding\nclusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making\nthem prime candidates for black hole searches with {\\it Gaia}. Our results\nhighlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation\nmechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole\nproduction. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial\nconditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star\nformation community."}

If the EP\nis violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response\nto a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a\ndipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of\nthe bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified\nwith a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum\nof distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using\nquadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional\napproach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic\nestimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall\namplitude of EP violation.

An additional\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions\ncharged under $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs\nthrough the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the\ngenerated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact\nlepton-number conservation.

However, the small PSF\nsize provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making\nit difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions\nunusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each\nexposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4\narcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF\nexhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed.\nAdditionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the\nfilters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no\nsignificant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time\n(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212\n(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be\ncustomized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even\ngreater due to its depth.

In this paper, we\npresent new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~\n7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength).

The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$\nFroggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa\ncouplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions\ncharged under $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs\nthrough the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the\ngenerated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact\nlepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the\nsmallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical\nstudies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent\nwith relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection\nconstraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection\nbetween neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free\nsetup."}

We show\nthat bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating\ngravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual\nhalos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo\nbinaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at\ninitially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency\nbands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the\nresulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations\nto distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny\nfraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such\neffects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through\nGW observations."}

Two standard approaches are\ncommonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function\nmethod, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime\nthey yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit\ntime and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the\neffective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different\nlimiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result\nand the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are\nunderstood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which\nclarifies the origin of their disagreement."}

These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic\nmagnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are\nindeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that\nobservations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the\nprimordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the\nprimordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In\nLQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an\nelectromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its\nevolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We\ninvestigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is\nscale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions,\ndiscuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and\ncompute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today.

We study how the companion's spin controls\nthis process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of\nthe companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass\naccretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down\nand secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane.\nCollisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin\ncorrelation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \\simeq 2.8$, much\nlarger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely\nindependent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated\nspin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of\nrapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM\nenvironments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from\ndynamical friction."}
