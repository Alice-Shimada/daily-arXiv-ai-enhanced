This degeneracy makes it impossible to determine the neutrino mass\nordering in oscillation experiments if neutrinos have new vectorial\ninteractions with matter. As the composition of solar neutrinos at the Earth\nconsists of all three neutrino flavors, testing the presence of new neutrino\ninteractions in the muon and tau neutrino sector in scatterings can fully probe\nthe LMA-Dark region for the first time. In this paper we show that current data\nfrom XENONnT and PandaX-4T does not yet exclude the LMA-Dark region with equal\ncouplings of a new mediator to muon and tau neutrinos and quarks, and we\nidentify the possible experimental scenarios to do so in the future.

Similarly, direct collapse\nblack holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely\nmetal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the\nmost massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code\nA-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD\ndemographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH\npopulation against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models\nagree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties.\nFurthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to\nbe systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to\nreproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios -\nhigh dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed\nto explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington\naccretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on\nstellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be\nreproduced.

We aim to derive a statistically robust and physically accurate\ndistribution of CO BEs on ASW surfaces, and to evaluate its implications for\nlaboratory temperature-programmed desorption experiments and interstellar\nchemistry, with a focus on protoplanetary disks.\n  Methods. We trained a machine-learned potential (MLP) on 8321 density\nfunctional theory (DFT) energies and gradients of CO interacting with\ndifferently-sized water clusters (22-60 water molecules). The DFT method was\nselected after extensive benchmark. With this potential we built realistic\nnon-porous and porous ASW surfaces, and computed a BE distribution.

We find that both ASW morphologies yield similar Gaussian-like BE\ndistributions with mean values near 900 K.

We\nconstruct three worldline models. The first two are obtained by deducing their\nconstraint structure directly from the spacetime gauge transformations. By\napplying BRST quantization, we show that these models reproduce the BV spectrum\nand the associated BRST transformations of two specific fracton theories. The\nthird model is defined as a deformation of the second one: although free, it is\nanalyzed by drawing inspiration from the standard treatment of interacting\nworldline systems, and is shown to capture almost the entire family of\ncovariant fracton theories. Finally, we discuss the gauge-fixing, comparing the\nBV-BRST spacetime perspective with the worldline analogue of the ``Siegel\ngauge\" employed in string field theory."}

Using NIRCam\nimaging data from three surveys over $\\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field,\nwe found 117 galaxies with $\\geq 4$$\\sigma$ variability in the F356W band\nacross a $\\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic\ndata in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all\ncoincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the\nlast imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using\nthe archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic\nsubsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two\nothers form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be\nexplained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause.\nHowever, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines\n($\\Delta v > 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow\npermitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2\nbased on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair,\nshow no emission lines.

The key idea is that while spurious\nnon-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired\nwhen a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is\nrecovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\\it evolution} of\neccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked.

The method\ncompares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz),\nevolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at\nthose same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at\nany reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a\nmimicker.

Based on the unbiased\nMilky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey data of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO,\nand C$^{18}$O (J=1--0) line emission in two regions toward the inner and outer\nGalaxy, i.e. the G50 ($44.75\\deg \\le l \\le 60.25\\deg$) and G120 ($119.75\\deg\n\\le l \\le 130.25\\deg$) regions, the distribution of molecular gas is studied.\nBoth regions have Galactic latitudes of $|b| \\le 5.25\\deg$. A catalog\ncontaining 24724 MCs is constructed from the data. In our proximity, several\nmolecular structures with large angular scales and small velocity dispersions\nare discovered, resembling curtains of mist. Beyond the nearby molecular gas, a\nclear aggregation of MCs along coherent structures in the Galactic plane is\nvisible, sketching spiral arm structures. Nevertheless, the aggregation of MCs\nis also detected in the inter-arm region between the Perseus and Outer arms in\nthe G50 region. The Galactic molecular disk in this inter-arm region is found\nto be thinner than that in the adjacent spiral arm region. In addition, the\nthickness of the Galactic molecular disk examined here is found to be\ncorrelated with the warp of it, indicating their homologous origins. The\nmolecular disk has a typical thickness of ~220 pc in the inner Galaxy.\nMoreover, the dispersion of the MC systemic velocity decreases with increasing\ngalactocentric radius, resulting in lower kinematic distance uncertainties at\nlarger radii. However, the Perseus arm segment in the G120 region exhibits a\nrelatively large cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion and split components in its\nMC velocity distribution."}

Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced\na few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made\nit look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar\nformed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears.

There's yet another daunting problem generic to any\ninflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue\nof classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often\ntreated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked\nto tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any\nobservational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the\ncollapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the\ncollapse models do modify the Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system\nand the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints.

However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies\nare dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain\nso thereafter.

There's yet another daunting problem generic to any\ninflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue\nof classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often\ntreated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked\nto tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any\nobservational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the\ncollapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the\ncollapse models do modify the Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system\nand the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed\nmodified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations\nand can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\\it Planck},\n{\\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated\nwith the quantum primordial fluctuations.
