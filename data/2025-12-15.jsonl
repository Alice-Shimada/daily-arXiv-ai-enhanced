At high temperatures this process is governed by the weak breaking of conformal symmetry, and so in this limit many features of the hydrodynamic theory that emerges have been argued to be universal. In this paper we study aspects of the stress tensor thermal two-point function in holographic QFTs of this kind and show that they are consistent with the universal hydrodynamic theory proposed to apply at late times. Specifically, we identify the locations of the `pole skipping' points in momentum space at which there is an intersection of poles and zeroes of this two-point function in holographic QFTs. Although these points lie outside the regime where the hydrodynamic theory is controlled, we show that their locations are consistent with those found by resumming the hydrodynamic derivative expansion near the lightcone. For example, this resummation of the universal hydrodynamics correctly predicts the butterfly velocity of holographic theories."}

As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair\"); $\\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian."}

These duality frames are crucial for keeping the global complexity finite: insisting on a single frame extending across all such limits would yield a divergent complexity measure.

First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.\n  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\\simeq 0.2\\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants.

Although O2 is an important precursor molecule present during the early stages of ice formation, its surface diffusion in ASW remains poorly constrained. In this study, we experimentally investigate the surface diffusion and the entrapment efficiency of O2 in porous ASW under astrophysically relevant conditions. Experiments were conducted in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and monitored using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry. Diffusion coefficients were extracted through a novel approach applicable to IR-inactive molecules, by fitting the mass spectrometer signal during the isothermal phase with a Fickian model. These coefficients were then used to derive the diffusion energy barrier of O2 in ASW. Entrapment efficiencies were measured by analyzing the subsequent temperature-programmed desorption phase. We measured the surface diffusion coefficients at different temperatures (35 K, 40 K, 45 K) and water ice coverages (40 ML, 60 ML, 80 ML), yielding values on the order of 1E-16 to 1E-15 cm^2 s^-1. From these values, we derived a diffusion energy barrier of ED = 10 +/- 3 meV (116 +/- 35 K), corresponding to a chi ratio of about 0.1. Entrapment measurements revealed that a residual amount of about 20% of O2 remains trapped in the ASW matrix at the highest temperatures investigated. This work demonstrates that the surface diffusion of IR-inactive molecules can be experimentally quantified using mass spectrometry. Our findings show that O2 exhibits a low diffusion barrier, indicating high mobility in interstellar water ices. Moreover, we suggest these water ices likely retain a residual fraction of hypervolatiles entrapped within their structure."}

While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak."}

These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions.

These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions."}

Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs."}

In this work we model dark matter as an ultralight bosonic field, which can accrete onto the neutron star and form a composite object bound through gravity. Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum. This synchronization leads to new multi-state scalar configurations and reshapes the hierarchy of the neutron-star radial modes. We further propose a procedure to compute the values of the new dominant modes as a function of the bosonic mass, and discuss the implications for neutron-star physics and gravitational-wave astronomy."}

This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a multi-metallicity gas phase in this respect."}

We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\\geq 10$ per cent ($\\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics."}

In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe."}

In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character.

Although improved theoretical models exist for anisotropic clustering, their applicability is limited by the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of relative velocities. Here, we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of cross-correlation between galaxy clustering and 21-cm line intensity mapping. Based on Fisher matrix analysis, fully incorporating nonlinear RSD, we estimate the benefit of combining both observables. We find that, for spectroscopy surveys like DESI combined with 21-cm line-intensity mapping surveys, the constraint on the growth of structure is improved by a factor of two relative to the galaxy auto-correlation, while the constraint on the cosmic expansion is only slightly improved. Crucially, such an observation can strongly constrain the neutral hydrogen (HI) content Omega_HI to a sub-percent level. This level of precision unlocks the potential of this method to probe post-reionization astrophysics with enhanced precision. It would far surpass existing constraints from stacked 21-cm emission (resulting in ~ 50%-100% uncertainties) and break the degeneracy between Omega_HI and the HI bias b_HI inherent in linear-regime power spectrum analysis. This cross-correlation approach effectively compensates for the loss of constraining power when using galaxy clustering alone."}

Such detectors would complement existing gravitational wave observatories that rely on gravitoelectric effects."}

We examine how these stellar and BH populations influence the dynamics of the IMBH binary and, in turn, how the evolving IMBH binary affects the surrounding stellar and BH populations. We conduct high-resolution $N$-body simulations of NSCs constructed based on observational parameters from two local dwarf galaxies: NGC205 and NGC404. For the first time, we achieve a star particle mass resolution of $1\\rm\\;M_{\\odot}$ and a BH mass resolution of $10\\rm\\;M_{\\odot}$. This level of resolution is crucial for accurately modeling the collisional dynamics of these dense systems. Including stellar-mass BHs within the stellar population significantly influences the IMBH binary dynamics, nearly doubling the sinking rate and halving the merger time. During the initial phase of the inspiral, the IMBH binary disrupts both the stellar and BH cusps. However, the BH cusp quickly regains its steep slope due to its shorter relaxation time and continues to dominate the evolution of the IMBH binary, despite being much less massive compared to the stellar component. We uncover an interesting mechanism in which BHs first efficiently extract energy from the IMBH binary and then transfer this energy to the surrounding stars, allowing the BHs to spiral back toward the center of the system and restart the process. Our results imply that, although stellar mass BHs are a minor component of a stellar population, they can significantly facilitate IMBH growth within NSCs via mergers. We also notice that these dense systems can potentially boost Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) predominantly on radial orbits."}

A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry plays a crucial role in realizing this scenario, under which the Standard Model (SM) fermions are even, while new vector-like fermions present in the model are odd. A notable feature of this model is that the PS gauge boson $X_μ$ itself is $Z_2$-odd, causing it to couple exclusively between SM fermions and the vector-like fermions, except in the right-handed down-quark sector, where mixing is induced by the soft breaking of $Z_2$. This structure leads to helicity suppression of tree-level meson decays mediated by $X_μ$, with helicity-unsuppressed contributions arising only via one-loop diagrams. We show that $X_μ$ can be as light as 1.1 TeV while being compatible with all flavor-violating constraints. However, mass relations among the $(W'^\\pm_μ, Z'_μ, X_μ)$ gauge bosons push the $X_μ$ mass limit up to 4.3 TeV from the stringent LHC bounds on the $Z^\\prime$ mass. This comparatively low PS-breaking scale opens up promising collider opportunities for probing the leptoquark gauge boson, as well as the distinctive signature of vector-like down-type quarks carrying an unusual baryon number of $2/3$. The model can be further tested via lepton flavor-violating processes induced by the leptoquark gauge boson, such as $μ\\to e γ$, $μ\\to e e e$, and $μ$-$e$ conversion in nuclei. Neutrino masses arise in the model through dimension-seven operators at tree-level, as well as from dimension-five operators via one-loop diagrams."}

MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20--60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e > 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment."}

The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits. We also find that the disruption mechanisms include mergers driven by Lidov-Kozai cycles and breakups that occur when the companion surpasses the Hill radius of its orbit. Finally, we find that the presence of a companion would alter S2's astrometric signal by no more than $ 5\\,μ{\\rm as}$.

However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \\rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($δ_{\\mathrm{DE}}=θ_{\\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales.

We consider both flux-stabilized models and non-perturbative stabilization methods. We perform a holographic analysis to determine the spectrum of the assumed dual $CFT_3$ to understand its AdS/CFT implications. For the flux stabilization, which relies on a large complex Chern-Simons invariant, moduli have integer dimensions similar to the DGKT flux-stabilized model in type IIA. For the non-perturbative stabilization, the results are similar to race-track models in type IIB.\n  In the last part of the thesis, we solve the Wheeler DeWitt equation for the planar Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole in a minisuperspace approximation. We construct semiclassical Wheeler-DeWitt states from Gaussian wavepackets that are peaked on classical black hole interior solutions. By using the metric component $g_{xx}$ as a clock, these states are evolved through both the exterior and interior horizons. Close to the singularity, we show that quantum fluctuations in the wavepacket become important, and therefore the classicality of the minisuperspace approximation breaks down. Towards the AdS boundary, the Wheeler-DeWitt states are used to recover the Lorentzian partition function of the dual theory living on this boundary. This partition function is specified by an energy and a charge. Finally, we show that the Wheeler-DeWitt states know about the black hole thermodynamics, recovering the grand canonical thermodynamic potential after an appropriate averaging at the black hole horizon."}

One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon."}

We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}β$ and $\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}γ$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\\mathrm{H} \\gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\\sim O(10~M_\\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei."}

We explicitly show here that the genuine tripartite entanglement measure, i.e., the tangle vanishes identically for all flavors signifying that three flavor neutrino system form a W-type entangled state. Further, we investigate alternative measures of tripartite entanglement like the partial tangle and the concurrence fill which capture the total sharing of entanglement beyond pairwise correlations. In terms of bipartite and bi-partitioned entanglement measures, we derive the symmetric invariant and the concurrence fill, which quantify the distributed entanglement completely expressible in terms of flavor transition probabilities. These entanglement measures display distinct energy dependent patterns across the oscillation window which can be experimentally accessible in the long baseline experiments like DUNE providing an alternative quantum information perspective on flavor evolution. We use GLobal Long Baseline Experiment Simulator (\\textsf{GLoBES}) simulations within the DUNE set up to investigate these tripartite entanglement measures in terms of neutrino energy and the length of the baseline. It is observed that, at the point of maximal mixing, these measures show near maximal entanglement between the muon and the tau flavor modes establishing entanglement monogamy. Within the DUNE set up, the wide band of energy and expected higher sensitivity to CP-violation at second oscillation maximum provide a unique advantage to explore the quantum correlation effects across a broader energy window."}

Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = ξ\\mathcal{H} ρ_{\\rm m}$ and $Q = ξ\\mathcal{H} ρ_{\\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = Γ\\, ρ_{\\rm m} \\, ρ_{\\rm DE} \\, θ_{\\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $Γ$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $Γ$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $Γ= 0.0039 \\pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $Λ$CDM framework."}

We compare two alternative prescriptions for the running of the electric charge: (i) the conventional $μ$-running in minimal subtraction, and (ii) a ''physical'' running extracted from the logarithmic dependence of amplitudes on a hard scale $Q^{2}$ (e.g., $p^{2}$ or a Mandelstam invariant) after removing IR effects. At one loop, using dimensional regularization with an IR mass regulator $m$, we compute the photon vacuum polarization. We find a clean separation between UV and soft logarithms: the former is gauge and process independent and fixes the beta function, whereas the latter encodes nonlocal, IR-dominated contributions that may depend on gauge parameters and must not be interpreted as UV running. In the quadratic-gravity sector, the photon self-energy is UV finite--the $\\lnμ^{2}$ pieces cancel--leaving only $\\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$ soft logs. Consequently, quadratic gravity does not modify the one-loop UV coefficient and thus does not alter $β(e)$. Therefore, the physical running coincides with the $μ$-running in QED at one loop. Our analysis clarifies how to extract a gauge and process independent running in the presence of gravitational interactions and why soft logs from quadratic gravity should not contribute to $β(e)$."}

Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5.

As indicated in our cross-sectional analysis, at 9.16 TeV with a coupling parameter kappa = 0.5, the production probability reaches its peak. However, as the vector-like quark mass exceeds 3 TeV, the production significance diminishes rapidly. For the comparison, the study also performs calculations for proton-proton and electron-proton colliders to highlight the muon-proton collider's effectiveness in probing vector-like quarks.

The excited states are prepared by the Euclidean path integral in the CFT with a source turned on for some double-trace operator, with a small, $O(1)$ amplitude $λ$. On the gravity side, the double-trace operator deforms the bulk geometry as well as the entanglement structure of the state of bulk matter fields. By the quantum extremal surface formula, this leads to a deformation of the shape of the entanglement wedge, an effect which becomes manifest in the entanglement entropy at $O(λ^2 G_N)$. On the CFT side, we explicitly calculate the entanglement entropy perturbatively in the source amplitude to $O(λ^2)$, in terms of modular-flowed correlation functions of double-trace operators. We then evaluate these modular-flowed correlation functions using Witten diagrams. This calculation involves a Schwinger-Keldysh contour ordering prescription in the bulk, which we motivate using analytic continuation from Euclidean replica correlators. Focusing on a particular graviton-exchange diagram, we rewrite it in a form where it manifestly reproduces the canonical energy term present in the quantum Ryu-Takayanagi formula, including the shape deformation of the entanglement wedge due to backreaction and quantum effects."}

We find an anti-correlation between GC specific mass and galaxy stellar mass for dwarfs in Perseus similar to observations in other clusters. At fixed stellar mass, dwarfs with lower surface brightness or larger effective radius tend to be more GC-rich -- suggesting either high GC formation efficiency in an earlier compact-galaxy phase, or less efficient GC disruption. The correlation between GC richness and axis ratio in Perseus is weaker than in other environments. We find some connection between GC richness and infall time, but not with the clear correlations found in Virgo, Coma, and cosmological simulations.

Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations."}

In these environments, collisions can shape the stellar mass function and produce exotic stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how stellar collisions couple with stellar evolution in the inner parsec of an NSC. We simulate the evolution of a sample of $1000$ $1$ $M_\\odot$ stars embedded in a uniform cluster of dynamically relaxed 0.5 $M_\\odot$ stars. Using COSMIC to evolve stellar properties in time , we track the mass, radius, and evolutionary state of the stars as they collide in the cluster. Our results show that most stars within $0.1$~pc of the SMBH experience a collision while on the main-sequence. However, outside of this distance, stars collide during the red giant phase, when the stellar radius increases dramatically. We find that the most common type of collision -- main-sequence or red giant -- over the lifetime of the cluster depends on the steepness of the stellar cusp, which determines the spatial distribution of the stars in the cluster. These results show that stellar evolution plays a fundamental role in shaping the collisional history of stars in nuclear star clusters. Lastly, we consider whether the closest known stars to the Milky Way's SMBH have experienced a collision. We estimate that several of the S-stars have a high probability of experiencing a collision over their main-sequence lifetime, perhaps with implications for their observed youth and properties."}

Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5.

Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $μ$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry. However, magnetic field strengths inferred using DCF-type methods systematically overestimate intrinsic values from the simulations by factors $\\gtrsim 2$. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that field alignment and amplification are primarily driven by external gas pressure from the expanding HII region rather than internal turbulence, thus violating key assumptions of the DCF method.

At $z\\approx 0$, COLIBRE reproduces the observed (spatially-resolved) KS relations for HI and H$_2$, including the associated scatter, which we predict to be significantly correlated with stellar surface density, local specific SFR (sSFR), and gas metallicity. We show that the HI KS relation steepens for lower-mass galaxies, while the H$_2$ KS relation shifts to higher normalisation in galaxies with higher sSFRs. The H$_2$ depletion time decreases by a factor of $\\approx 20$ from $z = 0$ to $z = 8$, primarily due to the decreasing gas-phase metallicity. This results in less H$_2$ and more HI being associated with a given SFR at higher redshift. We also find that galaxies with higher sSFRs have a larger molecular gas content and higher star formation efficiency per unit gas mass on kpc scales. The predicted evolution of the H$_2$ depletion time and its correlation with a galaxy's sSFR agree remarkably well with observations in a wide redshift range, $0\\le z\\le 5$."}

We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\\geq 10^\\circ$, multipoles $\\ell \\leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere.\n  We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation.\n  The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization."}

By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion-size relation (sigma proportional to L^0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) proportional to k^-1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (alpha_vir proportional to M^-0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps."}

Even when two underlying dynamics happen to give similar inclusive jet rapidity distributions, such observables are too coarse to discriminate their underlying rapidity point processes, whereas the rank-ordered distributions remain sensitive to the differences in how rapidity space is filled. For fixed multiplicity (N=3) and for the second-most-forward/backward jets across multiplicities, BFKLex populates the rapidity interval more democratically, whereas the general-purpose event generators exhibit comparatively stronger edge enhancement for N=3 and narrower, more centrally concentrated distributions for the second-most ranks. These shape differences are stable under variations of jet radius, proton PDFs, and MPI/hadronization settings, and persist when requiring large rapidity separation between the outer jets. Rank-ordered rapidities thus compress genuinely exclusive information about the multi-jet final state into one-dimensional, normalized histograms that are directly measurable with existing dijet and Mueller-Navelet selections and provide a new handle on high-energy radiation patterns."}

Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \\pm 0.47$ mag) and H$α$ equivalent width ($3750\\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models.

As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives.

Among them, 4-oxobutanenitrile (\\ch{HCOCH2CH2CN}) has been identified in laboratory simulations as a plausible intermediate in the formation of glutamic acid, a proteinogenic amino acid. Here, we report its gas-phase rotational spectrum, measured using two complementary techniques: chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy (2$-$18 GHz) and free-jet millimeter-wave (FJ$-$AMMW) absorption spectroscopy (59.6$-$80 GHz). Quantum chemical calculations revealed nine low-energy conformers, of which the TC conformer was assigned based on the measured spectra. The resulting spectroscopic parameters were used to search for the molecule in the ultradeep spectral survey of the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, located in the Galactic Center.

We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\\geq 10^\\circ$, multipoles $\\ell \\leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere.\n  We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation.\n  The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements.

At leading order in the QCD coupling, the di-jet cross-section exhibits transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorisation, with a gluon diffractive TMD distribution (DTMD) which is controlled by gluon saturation and describes the transverse-momentum imbalance between the produced jets. The next-to-leading corrections generate the various quantum evolutions of the diffractive gluon distribution. We focus on the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolution which describes the change in the gluon DTMD when increasing the ''hard scale'' (the typical transverse momentum of the di-jets). We consider two different representations for this equation, one in transverse-momentum space, the other one in transverse-coordinate space. They are not fully equivalent with each other (despite being related by a Fourier transform) because of the respective boundary conditions. These conditions encode the essential physics of gluon saturation together with the effects of two other types of quantum evolution: the BK/JIMWLK evolution over the rapidity gap (''inside the Pomeron'') and the DGLAP evolution outside the rapidity gap (''within the diffractive system''). We demonstrate that, due to gluon saturation, one can compute both the boundary conditions and the CSS solutions fully from first principles, without reference to non-perturbative physics.

A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry plays a crucial role in realizing this scenario, under which the Standard Model (SM) fermions are even, while new vector-like fermions present in the model are odd. A notable feature of this model is that the PS gauge boson $X_μ$ itself is $Z_2$-odd, causing it to couple exclusively between SM fermions and the vector-like fermions, except in the right-handed down-quark sector, where mixing is induced by the soft breaking of $Z_2$. This structure leads to helicity suppression of tree-level meson decays mediated by $X_μ$, with helicity-unsuppressed contributions arising only via one-loop diagrams. We show that $X_μ$ can be as light as 1.1 TeV while being compatible with all flavor-violating constraints. However, mass relations among the $(W'^\\pm_μ, Z'_μ, X_μ)$ gauge bosons push the $X_μ$ mass limit up to 4.3 TeV from the stringent LHC bounds on the $Z^\\prime$ mass. This comparatively low PS-breaking scale opens up promising collider opportunities for probing the leptoquark gauge boson, as well as the distinctive signature of vector-like down-type quarks carrying an unusual baryon number of $2/3$. The model can be further tested via lepton flavor-violating processes induced by the leptoquark gauge boson, such as $μ\\to e γ$, $μ\\to e e e$, and $μ$-$e$ conversion in nuclei. Neutrino masses arise in the model through dimension-seven operators at tree-level, as well as from dimension-five operators via one-loop diagrams."}

Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5.

We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies.

We use dimensional analysis to systematically evaluate expected hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, leading to structural relations between potential LHC observables, such as di-boson resonances, tau pair production or the di-photon channel.

The sample consists of low-surface brightness (LSB) and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) located inside 0.4 R$_{vir}$ of the Hydra I cluster. Integral field spectroscopy is acquired for 24 galaxies with the MUSE spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Aims: Our main objective is to analyse possible correlations between the environment and the integrated stellar population properties. Methods: For each galaxy, we extract the 1D stacked spectrum in an aperture of one effective radius and adopt previously published stellar kinematics to derive age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] through a full spectral fitting technique. Results: We find that the analysed LEWIS sample has a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -0.9 dex, a mean age of 10 Gyr, comparable to results of UDGs in other clusters. According to the projected phase-space, galaxies can be classified into two groups: early infallers, with slightly higher metallicities ([M/H]$_{early} = -0.8 \\pm 0.1$ dex), and late infallers, with slightly lower values ([M/H]$_{late} = -1.0 \\pm 0.1$ dex). Two types of galaxies are found in the early-infall region: half of them have metallicities consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation, while the other half show higher values. Moreover, they display different timescales for stellar mass assembly. Conclusions: We identified different classes of UDGs in the Hydra I cluster, which suggest different formation mechanisms taking place. Almost all of the UDGs and LSBs in the cluster are consistent with the puffed-up dwarf formation scenario, having dwarf-like metallicities and being consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation. In the innermost regions of the cluster, where metal-richer UDGs lie, tidal or environmental effects might have influenced their formation and evolution."}

Accepted to AAS Journals December 10, 2025. The Subaru and HST photometric catalogs are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17398573", "summary": "A merger origin has been suggested for M83's massive, metal-rich extended HI disk and nuclear starburst. We observe M83's stellar halo to test this idea. We train nearest-neighbor star-galaxy separation on wide-area Subaru imaging with Hubble Space Telescope data to map M83's halo in resolved stars. We find that M83 has an extended, very low density smooth stellar halo of old and metal-poor [M/H]$\\sim -1.15$ RGB stars with a mass between 15 and 40 kpc of $\\log_{10}M_{*,15-40,maj}/M_{\\odot}=8.02\\pm0.10$. In addition to M83's well-known Northern Stream, our ground-based Subaru imaging reveals a new stream to M83's south, which modeling suggests could be its trailing arm. The combined stream masses are $\\log_{10}M_{stream}/M_{\\odot}=7.93\\pm0.10$, with metallicity [M/H]$= -1.0\\pm0.2$. The stream progenitor was only recently accreted, as its stellar populations suggest that it formed stars until $2.1\\pm1.3$ Gyr ago. M83 lies on the stellar halo mass-metallicity correlation seen for other Milky Way mass galaxies, albeit with low stellar halo mass. We infer a total accreted mass of $\\log_{10}M_{*,accreted}/M_{\\odot}=8.78^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$, with the most massive past merger having $\\log_{10}M_{*,dom}/M_{\\odot}=8.5\\pm0.3$. We identify plausible M83 analogs in TNG-50 with similar stellar halos, finding that while a recent accretion can create a prominent stellar stream, such accretions do not trigger starburst activity, nor do they deliver enough gas to form M83's extended Hi disk. We conclude that other non-merger mechanisms, such as secular evolution or accretion of gas from the IGM, are likely to be responsible for M83's remarkable properties."}

Going beyond simplified models, such a theory can be described in a gauge-invariant and agnostic way via an EFT with a non-linearly realized electroweak symmetry. In this extended HEFT, depending on the $SU(2)$ nature of the new scalar in the UV, operators will be suppressed by different powers of a heavy mass scale. We use dimensional analysis to systematically evaluate expected hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, leading to structural relations between potential LHC observables, such as di-boson resonances, tau pair production or the di-photon channel. Once future collider data reveals a hint of a new scalar field, it can be fitted to this extended HEFT and such a structural analysis will help interpret it with respect to possible UV models, circumventing the need to individually test each possible model on the data or to fix the $SU(2)$ representation of the new scalar beforehand. For illustration, the framework is applied to the tentative 95 GeV resonance. In addition to its usefulness for collider physics, the extended HEFT can also be beneficial for low-energy observables, allowing to describe new scalars in an agnostic way."}

Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances."}

While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak."}

Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies", "comment": "24pages, 16 figures, 4 tables. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments and feedback are warmly welcomed!", "summary": "We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$λ\\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \\pm 0.47$ mag) and H$α$ equivalent width ($3750\\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1σ$ involve a hot ($T_{\\rm eff}\\!\\simeq\\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions."}

As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair\"); $\\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian."}

By comparing the observed gas angular momentum vectors with those predicted from the primordial density field reconstructed by ELUCID for the nearby universe, we conclusively detect a strong direction correlation with a significance of about $7σ$.

These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions. Finally, we derive the flat-space limit of the $1$-loop inflationary correlator and verify it with explicit examples, thereby establishing a direct correspondence between its leading total-energy singularities ($ω_T\\rightarrow0$) and the flat-space scattering amplitude."}

With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = ξ\\mathcal{H} ρ_{\\rm m}$ and $Q = ξ\\mathcal{H} ρ_{\\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = Γ\\, ρ_{\\rm m} \\, ρ_{\\rm DE} \\, θ_{\\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $Γ$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $Γ$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $Γ= 0.0039 \\pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $Λ$CDM model.

We compare two alternative prescriptions for the running of the electric charge: (i) the conventional $μ$-running in minimal subtraction, and (ii) a ''physical'' running extracted from the logarithmic dependence of amplitudes on a hard scale $Q^{2}$ (e.g., $p^{2}$ or a Mandelstam invariant) after removing IR effects. At one loop, using dimensional regularization with an IR mass regulator $m$, we compute the photon vacuum polarization. We find a clean separation between UV and soft logarithms: the former is gauge and process independent and fixes the beta function, whereas the latter encodes nonlocal, IR-dominated contributions that may depend on gauge parameters and must not be interpreted as UV running. In the quadratic-gravity sector, the photon self-energy is UV finite--the $\\lnμ^{2}$ pieces cancel--leaving only $\\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$ soft logs. Consequently, quadratic gravity does not modify the one-loop UV coefficient and thus does not alter $β(e)$. Therefore, the physical running coincides with the $μ$-running in QED at one loop. Our analysis clarifies how to extract a gauge and process independent running in the presence of gravitational interactions and why soft logs from quadratic gravity should not contribute to $β(e)$."}
