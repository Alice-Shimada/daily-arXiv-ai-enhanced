Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will\ncommence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of\nastronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged\nstars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific\nworkflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic\ncataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed\nproblem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational\ninefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband\ncoadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we\nexplore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior\nestimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to\nachieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the\nDC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to\nmimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in\nlight source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and\ngalaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior\napproximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data,\nillustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification.\nAlthough some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application\nof NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its\neffects."}

Once the invariant mass is corrected with the tagged\nFSR jet, the mass resolution of the signal is greatly enhanced, and the\nsensitivity of the search is also improved by 10-20%.

The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in\nthe Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB\nobservations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can\nhave significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations,\n$n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group\nimproved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the\nPlanck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions\nin the Einstein frame: $y < 4.5 \\times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper\nlimit on the reheating temperature $T_{\\rm RH} < 2 \\times 10^{11}~{\\rm GeV}$,\nwhereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \\times 10^{-4} < y\n< 5.6 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \\times 10^{11} ~{\\rm GeV} < T_{\\rm RH} < 2.8\n\\times 10^{11}~{\\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker\nconstraints.

We employ new quantum insights into the physics of\nnear-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim\ngravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to\nrevisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum\ncorrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action\nthat parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries.

Using Jackiw-Teitelboim\ngravity as a toy model, we establish the validity of the quantum Bousso bound\nand prove the restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC), which is a central\nassumption in semiclassical gravity and holography. Interestingly, we find\nviolations of the original QFC in this model. Building on these results, we\nintroduce a covariant prescription for computing holographic entanglement\nentropy in the static patch holography description of de Sitter space and\nexplore a generalization to closed FLRW spacetimes. This leads us to a\nformulation of subregion-subregion duality, where entanglement between\ncomplementary holographic theories gives rise to bulk connectivity. Causality\nconsiderations imply that entanglement wedges are bounded by surfaces that are\nnot extremal in the usual sense, but instead satisfy an extremization with\nconstraint. Finally, we discuss the connected wedge theorem, which establishes\na relation between the causal structure of spacetime and information-theoretic\nconstraints in the holographic dual. We argue that maintaining the consistency\nof static patch holography with this theorem leads to constraints on the causal\nstructure of the dual theory. Our results suggest a novel relationship between\nstatic patch holography and the dS/CFT correspondence."}
