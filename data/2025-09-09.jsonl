One\npromising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar\nhost galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc\nBasis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to\npredict flux ratios from mock imaging data.

We analyse how the boundary in the\n$N_\\mathrm{H} - \\lambda$ plane, defined by the column density versus the\nEddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters\n(metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little\ndust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely\naccumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can\nprovide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as\nobserved in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring\nclouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column\ndensities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity\nenvironments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN\nradiative dusty feedback scenario.

In this view, we carefully addressed the influence\nof the spin parameter $a$ and the hair parameter $h$ on the BH shadow images.\nThe results indicate that for smaller values of $h$, the BH shadow contours\nshift noticeably towards the right side of the screen, while for larger values\nof $h$, the nearly circular shadow gradually deforms into a ``D'' shape\nprofile. For a celestial light source, the larger values of $h$ lead to a\nreduction in the corresponding radius of the photon ring, while the\nspace-dragging effect becomes more pronounced with increasing $a$. We further\ndiscuss the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and\nretrograde accretion disk scenarios.

The unstable magnetic field is either imposed through\nthe boundary conditions or generated by an imposed $\\alpha$-effect. In the case\nof an imposed field, we solve for the deviations from the background state with\nperiodic boundary conditions. We also include cosmic rays as a weightless fluid\nwhich exerts a dynamically significant pressure and amplifies magnetic\nbuoyancy, known as the Parker instability. Without rotation, systems with an\nimposed magnetic field evolve to a state with a very weak magnetic field, very\ndifferent from the marginally stable eigenfunction, where the gas layer\neventually becomes very thin as it is supported by thermal and turbulent\npressures alone. However, this does not happen when the $\\alpha$-effect\nmaintains the magnetic field. Rotation fundamentally changes the development of\nthe instability. A rotating system develops nonlinear oscillations, and the\nmagnetic field direction changes even with an imposed magnetic field. We\ndemonstrate that the cause is a secondary $\\alpha$-effect at large altitudes as\nthe gas flow produced by the instability becomes helical. The secondary\n$\\alpha$-effect has an anomalous sign with the $\\alpha$-coefficient being\nnegative in the northern hemisphere, whereas the Coriolis force produces a\npositive $\\alpha$. The mean-field dynamo action outside the original gas layer\ncan also lead to a switch in the magnetic field parity from quadrupolar to\ndipolar.

In this paper we introduce Neural Posterior\nUnfolding, a modern, Bayesian approach that leverages normalizing flows for\nunfolding. By using normalizing flows for neural posterior estimation, NPU\noffers several key advantages including implicit regularization through the\nneural network architecture, fast amortized inference that eliminates the need\nfor repeated retraining, and direct access to the full uncertainty in the\nunfolded result. In addition to introducing NPU, we implement a classical\nBayesian unfolding method called Fully Bayesian Unfolding (FBU) in modern\nPython so it can also be studied. These tools are validated on simple Gaussian\nexamples and then tested on simulated jet substructure examples from the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). We find that the Bayesian methods are effective and\nworth additional development to be analysis ready for cross section\nmeasurements at the LHC and beyond."}

The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law\nthat has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. The small\nscatter in this relation has been used to argue against severe tidal mass loss\nin Local Group satellites. Aims. We aim to show that the observed scatter is\nconsistent with tidal mass loss seen in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in\nsimulations, using simulated Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project as\nan example. Methods. We analyze the stellar masses and mean metallicites for\nall accreted systems in Auriga. We compute these quantities two ways:\nconsidering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the\nbound progenitor. For both cases we fit the mass-metallicity relation and\nconsider properties that drive scatter about these relations. Results. Accreted\nsystems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and\nmetallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only\nconsidering the bound progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation\nhas similar scatter ($\\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Milky Way and M31\nsatellites ($\\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have\nexperienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their\ntotal stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation\ncan lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites that are\nsubstantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact.

Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict\nwhich Milky Way and M31 satellites have experienced substantial mass loss.\nThese predictions will be tested with deep resolved-star observations from\nupcoming facilities including Rubin LSST, Euclid, and Roman."}

We first provide a direct proof that, under first order\nperturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the\nWald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute\nthe gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon\nand the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the\napparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole\nentropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret\nthe generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as\nthe matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows\nus to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy\nevaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity."}

It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our\nunderstanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment\nand habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on\nthe core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting\nsIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the\ngalaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the\ndependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is\nportrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas\nkinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of\nthe gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's\nvariability.

In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of\nPBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood\nanalytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and\nreproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the\nPBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some\nearlier studies.

We calculate\nmassive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2<z<5$, finding values three\ntimes larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with\nmore-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution\nsimulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent\ngalaxy number density at $2<z<3$, however they still increasingly fall short at\n$z>3$, with discrepancies of up to $\\simeq 1$ dex.

In this paper,\nwe explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field\nduring inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing\ncoupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT\nresults by increasing both $n_s$ and $\\alpha_s$, particularly in the\nstrong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional\ninflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have\nalready been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in\ncertain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the\nspectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running\n$\\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is\napplicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also\ndiscuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting\nthat parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in\nfuture observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow\nfor such a large mixing."}

Standard approaches\nmodel transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) observables in impact-parameter space\nand compare them with data after Fourier inversion, generating an interplay\nbetween perturbative terms, non-perturbative models, and prescriptions used to\nextend perturbation theory beyond its natural domain. In this work, a\nconsistent methodology to perform the Fourier inversion analytically is\nproposed, achieving a solid resummation of TMD parton distributions and cross\nsections directly in transverse-momentum space. The resummation is carried out\nto next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, validated against alternative\nprescriptions, and tested on experimental data. This framework provides a\nsystematic procedure to analytically continue observables into the deep\ninfrared, identifying two primary sources of non-perturbative effects: the low\nenergy behavior of the strong coupling and of the parton distribution\nfunctions. This points to a paradigm shift in TMD phenomenology, where the\nstructure of hadrons emerges from the dynamics of QCD itself rather than from\nflexible parametrizations with only indirect physical interpretation."}
