The majority of previous work has utilised N-body\nsimulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal.\nHere, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic\nsimulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback\nfrom massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also\nscale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or\nfaster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We\nfind that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink\nparticles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a\nsimulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we\nwould expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the\ndynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities\ndirectly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with\n(sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback\nprocesses does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the\nexpansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions."}

First, using\nstandard gluon factorization to determine all terms with poles, we show how\ngauge invariance uniquely fixes the piece with no poles (the \"contact term\")\nfrom only terms that have a single pole. This allows us to write a YM recursion\nnot only for the full amplitude but also for the amplitude up to any order in\nthe Laurent series.

This setup defines a family of classical open-string\nS-matrices that smoothly interpolates between perturbative parton scattering at\nweak coupling and flat-space string scattering at strong coupling. We focus on\nthe four-point amplitude, which exhibits a remarkably rich structure: nonlinear\nRegge trajectories, dual conformal invariance, an intricate spectrum of bound\nstates with an accumulation point, and a two-particle cut. Dual conformal\ninvariance relates the spectrum of Regge trajectories to the energy spectrum of\nthe Maldacena-Wilson cusp Hamiltonian. This connection allows us to use\nintegrability to compute the leading and subleading Regge trajectories at\nfinite coupling, which we then input in the bootstrap analysis. At strong\ncoupling, we use the worldsheet bootstrap to construct the first\n$AdS$-curvature correction to the Veneziano amplitude. We apply dispersion\nrelations and S-matrix bootstrap techniques to derive bounds on Wilson\ncoefficients, couplings to bound states, and the overall shape of the\namplitude. We find that the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ amplitude saturates the bootstrap\nbounds at weak coupling and nearly saturates them at strong coupling. At\nintermediate coupling, the amplitude traces a nontrivial path through the\nallowed space of observables. To characterize this path, we combine the weak-\nand strong-coupling information about the amplitude to construct a\nfinite-coupling model for Wilson coefficients using a Pad\\'{e} approximation.\nThe resulting model satisfies bootstrap constraints and yields sharp\npredictions for the finite-coupling behavior of the amplitude.

Here, we adapt this\nformalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating\nsystematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce and\nvalidate an alternative method of mitigating the so-called `deprojection bias',\ncaused by the loss of modes after deprojection, employing the use of simple\nsimulations to compute a transfer function.

Additionally, we develop exact expressions\nfor the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which\nfurther improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on\nsimulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled\nfields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection\nfunction defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map.\nAfter computing and removing the bias in the shot noise and using a transfer\nfunction to correct for the remaining mode loss, our formalism is able to\nproduce unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios\ntested here.

We aim to quantify the impact of\ntidal interactions on radial migration and metallicity distribution in\nhigh-resolution simulations of LMC-like disc galaxies.

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution.

With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III]\nflux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on\nthe FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic\nhigh-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation\nwhere SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an\nintrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity\nvariations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat\nintrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these\nredshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in\nlow-mass galaxies.

For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where\nthe entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy\nthat is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for\nsuitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from\nthe ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis),\nwhich reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data."}

Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate,\nparametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, is highly susceptible to\ncontamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component\nseparation. In this work, we introduce an agnostic, model-independent procedure\nto construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the\nobserved angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of\nforeground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using\nthe Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These\nmaps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction,\nyielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after\ncomponent separation. The power spectrum of this residual map, after proper\nnoise debiasing, is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological\nlikelihood, thereby enabling unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. We\nvalidate the method on realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment,\nfocusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that\nincluding the residual template in the likelihood yields unbiased estimates of\n$r$, regardless of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the\nadopted masking strategy, thus proving the robustness of the proposed\nprocedure.

Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the\nmerger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger\nevent. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers\nbegins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times\nand SFRs to confirm this.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and\nstrong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild\nspacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric,\neven-parity quasinormal mode with $\\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency\n$\\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while\nkeeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent\nline-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a\nstatic observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic\nexpansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency\ncorrection that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere\nexpansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic\nstrong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small\noscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the\nbackground static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid\nmotion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are\ngauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing\nthat the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius\nmodulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field\ncorrection. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how\nringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing."}

The energetic early universe provides an exciting\nopportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with\nhigh-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK)\ngravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we\nillustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation\nand leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we\nconsider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized\nas inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an\nexplicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the\nradion modulus and the KK graviton modes.

Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties,\nsuch as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering\nblack holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in\nstatistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system,\nseveral questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be\nexplained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these\nquestions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored\nat the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this\nconnection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved\nspacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged\nself-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of\nstate which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black\nhole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach\nto quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes\nand self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase\ntransitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the\nformalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes.\nNamely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black\nholes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius.

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution.

Moreover, currently\nthe Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines\nthe constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018\nmeasurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues\nby incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual\ninflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor\nperturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency\nregion. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where\nthe entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy\nthat is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for\nsuitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from\nthe ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis),\nwhich reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data."}

The extended theory admits\na scalar-tensor description with a non-canonical kinetic term featuring poles.\nAs a result, the inflationary dynamics and predictions for observables of this\nmodel are insensitive to the specific form of F(R), since they are dominated by\nthe structure of the poles (order and residue). We analyze both a simplified\nversion analytically and the full eleven-parameter theory, and we classify the\nmodels based on whether they feature second-order poles, whether they are free\nfrom ghosts, and whether they predict a sufficiently small tensor-to-scalar\nratio. By relaxing the ghost-free requirement to only exclude ghosts near the\npole (where inflation occurs), we demonstrate that we can significantly enlarge\nthe set of viable models. We thus show that extended metric-affine F(R) gravity\ncan act as a robust framework for inflation, reproducing the attractor\npredictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio."}

In this work we challenge this view\nby analyzing a charged spherically symmetric black hole formed through\ngravitational collapse and evaporating via Hawking radiation. We show that the\nelectromagnetic repulsion and the violation of energy conditions due to the\npresence of Hawking radiation are be sufficient to avoid the formation of both\na singularity and a Cauchy horizon. We argue that a similar mechanism may apply\nto astrophysical black holes in which the role of the electric charge is\nreplaced by the angular momentum."}

In particular, it is often necessary to evaluate the shear\nviscosity $\\eta$ of fluids made up of more than one species, all interacting\nwith different cross sections. Since it may be difficult to extract information\non the interaction among different species, various combinations of the\nviscosities of the individual components are often used. We work in the\nChapman-Enskog framework and investigate on binary mixtures, by comparing such\nsingle component combinations with a full 2-component formalism: we find that,\nin most cases, the full viscosity is well approximated by a weighted linear\naverage of the single component viscosities, although this result is far from\nbeing general. Moreover, we validate our 2-component Chapman-Enskog results for\n$\\eta$ by comparing them with an independent numerical simulation of the\nBoltzmann equation, which estimates the shear viscosity via a Green-Kubo\nformula, in the case of a quasi-particle system that reproduces lattice QCD\nthermodynamics. We see that the temperature dependence of $\\eta/s$ of such\nsystem of quarks and gluons is not well described by combinations of the\nindividual components, highlighting the importance of inter-species scattering."}

However, is there\nany justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon?\nTo answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the\ntime slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single\ncoherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a\nsuperposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a\nhorizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum\nmacroscopic object. We provide a synthetic approach to understanding the\ninformation loss paradox from this perspective."}
