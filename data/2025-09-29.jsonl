Starting from the axion-modified Maxwell\nequations, we derive the axion-photon conversion probability and show how an\ninitial seed field boosts the final photon amplitude.

While this picture is exact in the noiseless, zero-temperature\nlimit, thermal fluctuations introduces stochasticity which can influence the\nbehaviour of the field configuration. In this work, we develop a purely\nstatistical criterion for identifying the critical bubble by leveraging the\nconcept of the ``committor'' probability: the likelihood that a given local\nfield configuration evolves to the true vacuum before returning to the false\nvacuum. Using ensembles of lattice simulations with controlled thermal noise,\nwe extract the committor probability during the evolution of a bubble from sub-\nto super-criticality. We find this approach to be robust, accounts for\nfinite-temperature effects, and allows independent verification of bounce-based\npredictions. To demonstrate this, we compare the average profile obtained via\nthe committor probability method to standard theory for a given model and find\nstrong agreement, particularly at the core of the bubble. Importantly, we also\nobserve that the behaviour of the committor probability with time is smooth and\nwell defined. This method establishes a robust, simulation-driven framework for\nstudying nucleation dynamics in thermal field theories and may be especially\napplicable in cases where analytical control might be limited."}

First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be\nperfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and\ndoes not necessarily involve an accelerated twin.

The damping timescale is of\nparticular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the\ncentral black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the\nsystematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited\nobservational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all\navailable data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria\nto avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range\nof AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the\nunderlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we\nintroduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting\nfor DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and\nleverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements.\nRather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT\nrobustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN\nphysical properties.

The motivation behind\nthis method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector\nmaps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation\npurposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it\nsimultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the\nN+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered\nby the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with\nthe three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two\nStokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent\nset of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly\ndifferent bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded\npolarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument\n(LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly\ncross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and\npolarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are\nstrongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed\nto individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise\nand temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated\ndata with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage\nis greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected."}

All these mappings are theory-independent\n-- they constitute relations among symmetries themselves, and, hence among the\nclasses of symmetry-invariant metrics and electromagnetic field strengths,\nrather than among specific solutions. Consequently, finding, e.g., vacuum\nTaub-NUT-type solutions in a given gravitational theory automatically yields\nvacuum NHEK- or swirling-type solutions of that theory, with a possible\nextension to the electromagnetic case."}

Their origin remains unclear and their\npresence seems difficult to reproduce in cosmological simulations of galaxy\nformation and evolution. In this Letter I present four examples of\nhigh-redshift bars selected from a sample of bar-like galaxies studied\npreviously using IllustrisTNG simulations. All the galaxies formed their bars\nat redshifts z > 3 via mergers with smaller satellites, although one had its\nbar formed even earlier, at z > 5. The bars were born long, with lengths on the\norder of 3 kpc, and grew in time. Three of the four galaxies were later\naccreted by clusters and underwent multiple interactions with their respective\nbrightest cluster galaxies. Their bar strength was to some extent affected by\nthese interactions but all the galaxies preserved their bar-like shape until\nthe present time. By the end of the evolution, all the galaxies lost their gas\nand stopped forming stars, they retained essentially no disk component and were\nno longer rotationally supported. The examples demonstrate that high-z bars do\nnot evolve into present-day barred disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way but\nrather into S0s or ellipticals typically found in galaxy clusters."}

While this picture is exact in the noiseless, zero-temperature\nlimit, thermal fluctuations introduces stochasticity which can influence the\nbehaviour of the field configuration. In this work, we develop a purely\nstatistical criterion for identifying the critical bubble by leveraging the\nconcept of the ``committor'' probability: the likelihood that a given local\nfield configuration evolves to the true vacuum before returning to the false\nvacuum. Using ensembles of lattice simulations with controlled thermal noise,\nwe extract the committor probability during the evolution of a bubble from sub-\nto super-criticality. We find this approach to be robust, accounts for\nfinite-temperature effects, and allows independent verification of bounce-based\npredictions. To demonstrate this, we compare the average profile obtained via\nthe committor probability method to standard theory for a given model and find\nstrong agreement, particularly at the core of the bubble. Importantly, we also\nobserve that the behaviour of the committor probability with time is smooth and\nwell defined.

Recent Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory studies of\ninterstellar ices have proposed an alternative pathway involving the\nradical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction in the overall mechanism of\nmethanol (CH3OH) formation in dark molecular clouds. Aims. A computational\nstudy was conducted to investigate the contribution of the radical-molecule\nH-atom abstraction route in CH3OH formation in interstellar ices, both in\nnon-shocked and shocked environments, and to examine how the physical\nconditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) affect the overall CH3OH synthesis\npathway. Methods. A set of chemical models were ran using the gas-grain\nchemical code UCLCHEM to systematically explore methanol synthesis in various\nphysical scenarios, including non-shock and low- and high-velocity C-shocks.\nResults. This work demonstrated for the first time that, under non-shock and\nshocked-influenced environments, the primary reaction leading to the formation\nof methanol in the inner layers of interstellar ices is indeed the\nradical-molecule H-atom abstraction route. However, such route is dependent on\nthe gas kinetic temperature (Tk), gas volume density (nH2 ), velocity of the\nC-shock wave (vshock), and cosmic ray ionisation rate ({\\zeta}). Furthermore,\ngaseous formaldehyde may trace C-type shocks and serve to differentiate\nmethanol formation pathways in low-velocity C-shocked environments, as its\nabundance varies more significantly than that of CH3OH with the inclusion of\nthe H-atom abstraction reaction in UCLCHEM. The H2CO/CH3OH ratio thus\nrepresents a potential diagnostic tool for this purpose."}

However, the\nsystematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited\nobservational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all\navailable data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria\nto avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range\nof AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the\nunderlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we\nintroduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting\nfor DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and\nleverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements.\nRather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT\nrobustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN\nphysical properties.

The motivation behind\nthis method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector\nmaps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation\npurposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it\nsimultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the\nN+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered\nby the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with\nthe three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two\nStokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent\nset of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly\ndifferent bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded\npolarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument\n(LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly\ncross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and\npolarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are\nstrongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed\nto individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise\nand temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated\ndata with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage\nis greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected."}

This will cause\nenhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced\npatchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy\nastrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power\nspectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing\nsignal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified\nastrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of\n$6.2\\sigma$ (and $17.4\\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will\nenable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the\nhigh-redshift observations of JWST."}
