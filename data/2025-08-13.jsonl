In close analogy\nwith physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops\nthat can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In\ncontrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that\nthe theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent,\nparticularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these\nissues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral\nrepresentation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We\nreview the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS\ncorrelators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex\noperators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel\ncomplications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between\ndifferent techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal\nseries fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer\nnew proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why\nrenormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET\nis the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation."}

In this work, we add ten\nfar-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for\ntwo spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616\n($z_{\\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing\nthe full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based\ninterpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously\nidentified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured\ngalaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively\nstar-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its\nmolecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth.\nIn contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a\nprolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in\nstellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})$ = 11.72\nover the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in\nboth UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may\nhave contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to\nform stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet\nsuppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio\nobservations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim3$."}

Since these instantons\ndescribe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that\nthey cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum\ncorrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the\ntoroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic\nidentifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime\nis geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical\nuniverse originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude\nthat the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be\ndescribed in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either\nimpossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics.

Although these\nfunctions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental\nfrequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the\ncoupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two\nstrategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate\nhigh-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first\nmethod maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second\nmethod fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated\ncoordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to\noverfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the\nmapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital\nfunctional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,\nwe propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate\nwith respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass\nquadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth\nderivative with a fractional residual $\\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.\nFor orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed\nin Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for\ncomputing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions.

We also find hints of a rapidly\nrotating oval structure within the primary bar, although it is not clearly seen\nin the imaging data. In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be\nclassified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are\nunusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the\nprimary bar.

When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black\nhole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their\nstellar masses, challenging models of early black hole--galaxy co-evolution.\nHowever, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the\nformation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes\nshaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$\nstate, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson\nscattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nsimulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their\nimprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong\ndeviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\\alpha$ and\nH$\\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden\nH$\\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield\nbroad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of\nstrong FWHM variations across transitions.
