BBN\noffers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton\nratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4\nabundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe,\nbecause not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP\nproblem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A\nrange of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would\nsignificantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced\nmodification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on\nthe axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV.\nRemarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\\rm\neff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross\nsections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as\nto the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for\nthe first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by\nenergetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying\ngeneral hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays."}

We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)_X$ gauge\nboson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar\nmediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\\chi$\nwhose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H_p$. For each model we derive\nannihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and\nsolve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and\na coupled $\\chi$-$\\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible\nearly departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In\nthis regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\\epsilon$\nrequired to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to\nensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\\epsilon\n\\ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into\nmediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current\nlimits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the\nirreducible neutrino background floor. Indirect constraints are typically weak\ndue to $p$-wave suppression, off-resonance $s$-channels, and cascade spectra\ncontrolled by $\\epsilon^2$. Finally, we highlight the most promising collider\ntests, which remain sensitive despite tiny portal couplings."}

The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert\nprofiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The\nsimulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a\nradius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the\ninitial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external\ndensity, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion\nas the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially\nincreases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that\nappear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also\ninfluences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with\nthe high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes\nsmaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a\nlong duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and\nmagnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing\nexternal density.

Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent\nunresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by\nupscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with\nobservations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass\nreveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating\nabove the Eddington limit.

We first\nconsider the quantum filed in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime.

Consequently, the\nformula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this\nreduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced\ntwo-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for\nthe non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the\nappearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of\nangular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time. Both\nquantities increases as the angular momentum increases, while decreases as the\ncharge increases. At last, we consider the near extremal case. Resort to the\nKerr/CFT correspondence, the near-horizon geometry of near extremal Kerr-Newman\nblack holes can be taken account for a warped AdS geometry. In this scenario,\nthe low-energy effective degrees of freedom are dominated by the Schwarzian\nzero mode, resulting in a one-loop correction to the partition function. The\nentanglement entropy is subsequently recalculated under the thermodynamic with\ncorrections. Through explicit calculations, we finally find that the Page time\nand the scrambling time exhibits quantum delays. This strongly suggests that\nthe near extremal geometry is governed by the Schwarzschild dynamics, in which\nquantum fluctuations result in a reduced rate of information leakage.

Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent\nunresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by\nupscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with\nobservations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass\nreveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating\nabove the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully\nreproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic\ntime and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra.

Here we\nconsider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter\nstate in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter\nthermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\\pi$. This\ntemperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local\nactivation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter\nenvironment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon.

In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium\n(ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal\nparticles and produce $\\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser\ngas, they produce more $\\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different\ncosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity of a\nturbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two\nquantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the\ncorrelation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must\nescape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\\gamma$-ray emission and be\nconsistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms\n(either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of\nmagnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps)\nis necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the\nsignificant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray\nreacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent\nreacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds\ndrive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray luminosity."}

We first\nconsider the quantum filed in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime.

Consequently, the\nformula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this\nreduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced\ntwo-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for\nthe non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the\nappearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of\nangular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time.

Published in Universe, as part of the Special Issue: \"The\n  10th Anniversary of Universe: Standard Cosmological Models, and Modified\n  Gravity and Cosmological Tensions\"", "summary": "Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and\nmatter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by\nintroducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants.\nTwo of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an\nadditional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which\ncan be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By\nadopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different\napproaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced\nparticle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible\nthermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor\nformulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle\ncreation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that\nirreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration\nthrough a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the\ncosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second\nlaw of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon\nand enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter\nphase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics.\nFurthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of\nmatter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the\nBoltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of\nthe Klein--Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in\ntime-varying gravitational fields."}

Starting from its\nformal expression obtained within the covariant perturbative expansion to\nlowest order in the curvature, we evaluate the RSET in an arbitrary number of\ndimensions in terms of coordinate-space distributions. For time-dependent\nspherically symmetric spacetimes, we derive a multipole expansion and determine\nits asymptotic behavior. We find that the RSET is locally nonvanishing at null\ninfinity and depends on the detailed dynamics of the collapsing body. However,\nthe total emitted energy vanishes at this order, meaning that the leading\ncontribution does not account for the energy density of the created particles.\nNevertheless, by enforcing stress-tensor conservation up to second order in the\ncurvature, we show that the total radiated energy can be extracted from the\nfirst-order RSET.
