Comments are welcome", "summary": "The interaction of quantum detector models with fields in curved spacetimes\nprovides fundamental insights into phenomena such as Hawking and Unruh\nradiation. While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between\nthe detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which\nare sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the\ncontext of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general\nframework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic\ndetector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a\ngeneric static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral\nexpression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct\nspacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we\ndemonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the\nprecise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon.\nFor a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the\nradiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct\ncorrespondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with\nthe modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative\ncoupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal\ncoupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive\nprobe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide\ndistinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and\nalternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime."}

We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized\nPost-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining\ntheory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of\nparameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our\napproach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful\nParametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine\nobservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and\nephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average\ndeviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\\sim\n10\\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\\bar{\\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and\n$\\bar{\\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\\%$ confidence level (GR\ncorresponds to $\\bar{\\alpha}=\\bar{\\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational\nparameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within\n$1\\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the\nability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and\ncosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We\nexpect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both\ncosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same\nunderlying gravitational interaction."}

However,\nrecent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full\nspectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light\ncurves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 < z < 2.71$, as a\nnoise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the\noptical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the\nZwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters,\ntwo for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for\ndescribing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO\nmodel describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than\nthe best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit\ncorrelations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black\nhole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the\nbest-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term\nvariability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal\nfluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term\nvariability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability\noriginating from the corona.

Since this\nsubstantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is\nattributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of\nwhite dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could\nsignificantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar\nclusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a\nsubstantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This\npaper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately\nreproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the\nobserved remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \\Nbody\nsimulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal\nthat simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of\nmirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability,\nthe presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system\n(BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power\nplant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between\nsingle and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire\nstellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the\nejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the\nfraction of dark remnants within the star cluster."}

We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field,\n$\\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into\nheavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a\nlepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon\nasymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\\phi$-dominated era and the entropy\ninjection from the decays of $\\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on\nthe GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that\ndistinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the\nparameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to\ndistinctive GW spectral features.

We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized\nPost-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining\ntheory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of\nparameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our\napproach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful\nParametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine\nobservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and\nephemeris of Mars.

Additionally, we investigate if the\nCaHK colours are strongly influenced by horizontal branch morphology through\navailable morphology measurements. In both of the CaHK colours, EXT8 and two\nother potential GCs below the metallicity floor can be selected from other\nmetal-poor GCs ([Fe/H] $\\leq$ -1.5) with CaHK-g showing the larger metallicity\nsensitivity. The RMS of linear fits to the metal-poor GCs show an uncertainty\nof 0.3 dex on metallicity estimations for both colours. Comparisons with u-g\nand g-z/F450W-F850L colours reinforce the notion that CaHK photometry can be\nused for effective candidate selection as they reduce false positive selection\nrates by at least a factor of 2. We find no strong influence of the horizontal\nbranch morphology on the CaHK colours that would interfere with candidate\nselection, although the assessment is limited by quantity and quality of\navailable data."}
