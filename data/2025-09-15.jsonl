Motivated by these shortcomings, we construct a spinor field-based\nGeneralized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model that unifies dark matter and dark energy\nwithin a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)\nspacetime. This framework incorporates a nonlinear spinor field and considers\nan open universe geometry. We constrain the model parameters using the latest\nobservational datasets, including Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon\ncompilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and\nSDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Employing Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, we obtain best-fit values that indicate\nthe spinor GCG model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the\nLambdaCDM, particularly in the late-time universe. Furthermore, the model\npredicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution\nto the Hubble tension. The results highlight the rich phenomenology of spinor\nfields and their possible role in the dynamics of dark energy through spacetime\ninteraction."}

Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this\nprocess, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners.

Addition to that, we consider\nthe case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination\ntaking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is\nproduced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold\ndark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples\nlater on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts\nsolely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium\never established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis\nis that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the\nmass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a\nprotracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH\nevaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic\nand smooth out the small scale structure at much later time.

Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how\nthe distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the\nefficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in\nlow-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they\nare accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nIn this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN\ncandidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey\n(VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio\nsource surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset\nAGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass,\nconsistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos.\nHowever, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses,\npotentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The\noffset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital\nradius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate\nof <0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar\nmasses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value\nassuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a\nrelatively low MBH seeding efficiency."}

The infrared\nemission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly\nmagnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas\ntidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN\nis buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by\nalmost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from\nthe inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses\nsilicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads\nto prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation\nstructure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent\nextinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated\nscattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge\nsubstantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the\ncentral black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine\nin later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features.

It is commonly approximated by a lognormal\ndistribution with a variance of $\\sigma_{s,V}^2 \\approx \\ln(1 + b^2 M_{\\rm\nV}^2),$ where $s \\equiv \\ln \\rho/\\rho_0,$ $M_{\\rm V}$ is the rms\nvolume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving\nmechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free),\nor a mix of the two. However, this neglects the correlation time of driving\n($\\tau_{\\rm a}$), which plays a key role whenever compressive driving is\nsignificant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of\nMach numbers, $1\\lesssim M_{\\rm V}\\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and\n$\\tau_{\\rm a}$ values.

The infrared\nemission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly\nmagnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas\ntidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN\nis buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by\nalmost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from\nthe inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses\nsilicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads\nto prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation\nstructure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent\nextinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated\nscattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge\nsubstantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the\ncentral black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine\nin later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results\nsuggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase\nearly in their evolution."}

Typical\ngrain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice\nmantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely\nto exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with\nconcomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain\nsurface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown\nthat this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several\nphysico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and\nreactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a\nparticularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify\nwhat is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess\nthe likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous\nstructural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an\nastronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory\nexperiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various\nastrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints\nand perspectives on cosmic dust porosity.

We find that in all scenarios, reionization\nwithin the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW\nand M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly\nearlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from\nlarge-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive\nfeedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit\nonly a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their\npresent-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends\naround M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before\nreionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest\nstellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes."}

To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider\nthe halo mass accretion rate, $\\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies:\nstellar mass gap, $\\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray\ncentroid shift, $\\left<w\\right>$. In general, the median values of these\nindicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both\nmass and redshift. We find $\\left<w\\right>$ to be the most reliable proxy,\nwhile $c_\\mathrm{x}$ and $\\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback\nmodel details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter\ndensity and $\\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively\n(positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to\nboth halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas\ndensities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\\left<w\\right>$,\nbut the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when\nstronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas\ndensity profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to\nwhat is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas\ndensity scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property\ncould be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven\nwinds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the\nintergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will\nbe uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a\nwarm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such\nsystems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and\nprovide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star\nformation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for\na star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\\, M_\\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the\nphotoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D\nray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra\nfor the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect\nof an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would\nrequire integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a\nbright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected\nnoise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the\n21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star\nformation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems\nclustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the\nsurrounding gas."}

We confront the uncertain\nlandscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around\ngroups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect\nprofiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses\n($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\\odot$) and redshifts ($0<z<1$), we find evidence of more\nefficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most\nstate-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and\nX-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$\nhydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce\npre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\\times$\nlower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $>8 \\sigma$\ndiscrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and\ntherefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark\nmatter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled\nand how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful\nbut less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements\nform a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a\nmore suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent\nsimulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are\ncritical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas\nexpulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution."}
