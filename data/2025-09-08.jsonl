In particular, in the standard QED in a\nstrong uniform electrical field, the Schwinger effect is implemented.\nCurrently, there exist the QED versions with empty fermionic vacuum without\nfluctuations of creation and annihilation of virtual electron-positron pairs.\nThese versions are the (QED)FW in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, the\n$(QED)_{KG}$ with spinor equations of the Klein-Gordon type, the $(QED)_{DN}$\nwith opposite signs in front of particle and antiparticle masses in Dirac\nequations and with the use of only states with positive energies in S-matrix\nelements.

An intriguing possibility\nis that DM does indeed interacts with SM particles only gravitationally (the\nonly mean by which we have detected it so far), albeit in an extra-dimensional\nscenario yet it has not been possible to detect it by some non-gravitational\nmeans. In a three-brane Randall-Sundrum setup, with DM located on a Deep\nInfra-Red GeV-TeV brane, and the SM on an Infra-Red TeV-PeV one, it was shown\nto be possible to recover the observed DM relic abundance and somewhat relax\nthe hierarchy problem, whilst avoiding LHC stringent bounds on DM and KK\ngraviton masses that constrain severely similar two-brane setups. The\nphenomenological results, however, has been obtained under the assumption that\nthe bulk curvatures on the left ($k_1$) and the right ($k_2$) of the\nintermediate IR-brane are identical, $k_2 \\to k_1$. Since the brane tension\n$\\sigma_{\\rm IR}$ of the intermediate brane is proportional to $k_2 - k_1$ and,\ntherefore, vanishes, it is clear that this limit (for which the IR-brane\nbecomes {\\em evanescent}) is unphysical. We could say that this is {\\em no\nbrane}: if the brane tension of a brane vanishes, there is no brane in the bulk\n(pun intended). In this paper, therefore, we study in detail the theoretical\nframework needed to explore this interesting phenomenological possibility, {\\em\nout of the evanescent brane limit}. We show that most of the formul\\ae $\\,$used\nin the {\\em evanescent limit} are still valid for ${\\cal O}(1)$ differences\nbetween $k_1$ and $k_2$ (thus, introducing no new unjustified hierarchy in the\nbulk).

We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of\nAGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of\nvarying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of\nstrong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively\nshort pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible\npost-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at\nz~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with\nsharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more\nsuccessful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop\nin the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some\ngroups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined\nby longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing\nfractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central\ntorus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power,\nnaturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting\nthat small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even\nin Evolution models.

For these\nfive models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions\nthat ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic\nevolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We obtain\nexact analytical solutions for $\\rho_{\\rm{dm}}$, $\\rho_{\\rm{de}}$, the\neffective equations of state ($w_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\rm{dm}}$,\n$w_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\rm{de}}$, $w_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\rm{tot}}$), and a\nreconstructed dynamical DE equation of state $\\tilde{w}$. Using these results,\nwe examine phantom crossings, address the coincidence problem, and apply the\nstatefinder diagnostic to distinguish between models. We show that energy\ntransfer from DM to DE inevitably produces negative energy densities and make\nfuture singularities more likely, while transfer from DE to DM avoids these\npathologies and is thus theoretically favored."}

Recent simulation-based\nwork has suggested that the anisotropy profiles of remnants like GS/E decline\ntowards the center and may be well-fit by an Osipkov-Merritt-type distribution\nfunction (DF).

Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves\nas a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve\nindividual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics,\ndynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of\na nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue\nthat NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven\ngas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas\nduring a gas-rich merger.

It is known that a massless, minimally\ncoupled scalar field removes the chaos. However, in more general Horndeski\ntheories, the situation is more complex. We find that in shift-symmetric\n$K$-essence theories, chaos persists if the scalar field contribution to the\ninitial-value constraint is {\\it subleading} compared to that of the\nanisotropies. In this case, solutions oscillate as they approach the\nsingularity, just as in the vacuum case, and a similar behaviour is found when\na non-minimal coupling is included. If the scalar field contribution is not\nsubleading, then chaos is removed and the singularity is approached smoothly.\n  An unusual and entirely new result appears when changing the sign in front of\nthe scalar kinetic term, yielding the theory of a phantom scalar. If the scalar\nfield is subleading, then solutions remain chaotic and oscillate when\napproaching the singularity, as before. However, if the scalar field is not\nsubleading, solutions are also chaotic, but the spacetime singularity\ndisappears, and the universe behaves as an apparently infinite sequence of\nanisotropic bounces. The spatial volume then oscillates within finite bounds,\nnever reaching zero, while the amplitudes and positions of these oscillations\nappear completely random.

Focusing on He ii 4686 {\\AA}, we show that the broad\nstellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is\ndiluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard\nto detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He\nii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere\ncode PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases\nreflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN\nstars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He\nii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar\nsignatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H <\n8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess\nof nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population\nsynthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this\nobserved WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic."}

Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced\nproduction of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a\nscale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral\ndensity has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a\nfast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in\nthe early universe."}

Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars\nacross the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the\nDIB's profile parameters.

An intriguing possibility\nis that DM does indeed interacts with SM particles only gravitationally (the\nonly mean by which we have detected it so far), albeit in an extra-dimensional\nscenario yet it has not been possible to detect it by some non-gravitational\nmeans. In a three-brane Randall-Sundrum setup, with DM located on a Deep\nInfra-Red GeV-TeV brane, and the SM on an Infra-Red TeV-PeV one, it was shown\nto be possible to recover the observed DM relic abundance and somewhat relax\nthe hierarchy problem, whilst avoiding LHC stringent bounds on DM and KK\ngraviton masses that constrain severely similar two-brane setups. The\nphenomenological results, however, has been obtained under the assumption that\nthe bulk curvatures on the left ($k_1$) and the right ($k_2$) of the\nintermediate IR-brane are identical, $k_2 \\to k_1$. Since the brane tension\n$\\sigma_{\\rm IR}$ of the intermediate brane is proportional to $k_2 - k_1$ and,\ntherefore, vanishes, it is clear that this limit (for which the IR-brane\nbecomes {\\em evanescent}) is unphysical.

We provide\nevidence that more generally, holographic CFTs are atypical in the space of all\nCFTs by finding similar results for permutation orbifolds: subgroups of $S_N$\nwith a good large $N$ limit are very sparse in the space of all subgroups.\nAlong the way, we derive several new results on the space of CFTs.

The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects\nthe feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and\ncoupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results\nfrom hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing\non the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid\nAGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive\ngalaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\\approx10^8$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. BH\nspins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs\n($M_\\mathrm{BH}\\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), and lower for other BH\nmasses. These trends are in good agreement with observations.

Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to\nenhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial\nblack holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in\nsuch models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of\nbackreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios.
