This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \\times L_t=48^3\\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_π=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications."}

We start by computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the model from the transfer matrix, which is numerically estimated using the coarse-grained tensor network. We then identify the quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates by using the symmetries of the system and the matrix elements of an appropriate interpolating operator. Next, we plot the energy for a particular quantum number and momentum as a function of system size to identify the number of particles in the corresponding energy eigenstates. With this method, we obtain one-, two-, and three-particle states. We also compute the two-particle scattering phase shift using Lüscher's formula as well as the wave function approach, and compare the results with the exact prediction."}

Bayesian evidence and parameter posteriors are obtained via nested sampling and marginalised over model choices. Applied to the quasars WFI J2033 - 4723, B 1608 + 656, and HE 0435 - 1223, we find strong evidence for non-stationarity in B 1608 + 656 and HE 0435 - 1223, while WFI J2033 - 4723 is consistent with stationarity. The stochastic component favours an Markovian exponential kernel for B 1608 + 656 and a non-Markovian Matérn-$\\frac32$ kernel for WFI J2033 - 4723 and HE 0435 - 1223.

We find differences in the spin and the concentrations of the LSBGs haloes and the host haloes of high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs), consistent with previous studies. By analysing their spatial and kinematical distribution of satellites, we find that LSBGs tend to have a larger number of satellites than HSBGs and with a larger velocity dispersion. Moreover, we obtain a continuous relation between the number of satellites and surface brightness, particularly for massive central galaxies. We also find a relation between surface brightness and the relative tangential velocity of the satellites. For a given stellar mass, the existence of LSBGs is strongly correlated with their satellite system dominated by rotation. Furthermore, the satellite system is systematically in counter-rotation with respect to the primary disc in LSBGs. We propose that this fact reflects that these galaxies have not experienced a significantly high rate of mergers, which are more likely associated with radial orbits expected in systems of galaxies with a high surface brightness."}

In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity.

Using crossing symmetry and the consistency of the operator product expansion in the dual CFT, we explicitly construct the one-loop contribution to the correlator at order $1/c^2$, both in position space and in Mellin space. We show that a strong form of the bootstrap equations imposes constraints on the value of $n$. Remarkably, we find that our bootstrap approach uniquely determines $n=21$, which corresponds to the spectrum of IIB string theory compactified on K3. This stands in sharp contrast to the tree-level correlator for which $n$ is unconstrained. We also analyse the spectrum of unprotected double-trace operators and solve the mixing problem in the first case that involves both tensor and graviton correlators. When $n=21$, the anomalous dimensions rationalise and one of them vanishes. Lastly, we study the flat-space limit of the correlator and find perfect agreement with the one-loop amplitude recently obtained in [arXiv:2510.24558]."}

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys."}

We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps.

Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$σ$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$σ$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization."}

Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions."}

The excess has been hypothesized to be due to the production of a new spin-1 or spin-0 particle, X17, with a mass of about 17 MeV. Recently, the PADME experiment has reported an excess in the $e^+e^-$ cross section at center-of-mass energies near 17 MeV, perhaps further hinting at the existence of a new state. Studies of the spin-1 case have hitherto focused on either vector {\\em or} axial-vector couplings to quarks and leptons, whereas UV theories more naturally produce {\\em both} vector and axial-vector (\\textit{i.e.} chiral) couplings, analogous to the Standard Model weak interactions. We consider the ATOMKI anomalies in the context of an $X$ with chiral couplings to quarks and explore the parameter space that can explain the ATOMKI anomalies, contrasting them with experimental constraints. We find that it is possible to accommodate the reported ATOMKI signals. However, the $99\\%$ CL region is in tension with null results from searches for atomic parity violation and direct searches for new low mass physics coupled to electrons. This tension is found to be driven by the magnitude of the reported excess in the transition of $^{12}{\\rm C}(17.23)$, which drives the best-fit region towards excluded couplings."}

Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter.

Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity."}

When parameterized in terms of the field content of heterotic supergravity, the resulting symmetry transformations give rise to momentum maps at the supergravity level, offering a duality-covariant interpretation of these objects. This framework provides a natural setting for the construction of conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry with internal symmetries, with direct implications for black hole thermodynamics and its higher-derivative corrections in a duality-covariant setting."}

We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it.

The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves."}

The four-dimensional IFT depends on a skew-symmetric linear operator acting on a Lie algebra, and when this operator is specialised to a solution of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, the IFT develops a semi-local symmetry associated with this solution. The resulting 4d analogue of the Yang-Baxter sigma model is related by symmetry reduction to the well-known 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model. An important implication that we find is the embedding of the equations of motion of the 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model in the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The 6d Chern-Simons theory on twistor space can alternatively be symmetry reduced to a 4d Chern-Simons theory configuration with disorder surface defects.

The 2009 solution is based on an average polynomial correction for each IR quadrant and is found to be poorly constrained at high fluence levels (e-) approaching the saturation limit. Using a variety of image types, sources, and sample sequences, we test a new pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025). In nearly all cases, the new correction improves the linearity at fluence levels higher than 50,000 e-, with improvements up to 7% for pixels with fluences approaching the saturation limit (80,000 e-) in the last ima reads. The pixel-based solution also significantly decreases the number of cosmic rays erroneously flagged (due to non-linearity correction errors) during ramp fitting in calwf3, leading to improved photometric accuracy in the calibrated flt data and higher signal-to-noise ratios, particularly in Quad 1 (upper-left detector quadrant). Because the new solution tends to make sources brighter, we recalibrate the five HST flux standards used to compute the IR zeropoints and find a negligible impact (0.1-0.2%) on the published values by Calamida et al.

In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=λφ^4$ and $V=μφχ+ λφ^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime."}

Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv < -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the \"Curious Case of Centaurus A\" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites."}

Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature.

After the constraint is imposed, the resulting Hayward-AdS black hole continues to exhibit Van der Waals-type $P-V$ criticality.

In addition, we extend the analysis by employing thermodynamic topology to characterize the global structure of the phase space. We find that the topological charge of the singular black hole is $-1$, whereas that of the Hayward-AdS black hole becomes $+1$. This change of topological charge indicates that the constraint not only regularizes the geometry but also induces a qualitative transformation in the thermodynamic configuration space."}

We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments. For a fixed stellar-mass cut of $M_* \\geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, the fraction of SMGs in the inner cluster-halo environment declines from $\\sim30\\%$ at $z=4$ to $\\sim3\\%$ by $z=1$, and similar trends are observed in other environments. The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\\%$ in low-density regions."}

Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation."}

This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $α=πT$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound.

To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation."}

We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,Ω_{\\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0<-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\\&SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1<q_0\\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\\to\\infty)=w_0+w_a<-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\\&SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $Λ$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations."}

Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7<z<2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $< 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos."}

In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols."}

Our analysis combines X-ray data from the XMM-XXL survey with shear measurements from the three-year shape catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. The analysis focuses on the XXL C1 sample, comprising 171 clusters for abundance modeling, a subset of 86 clusters located within the XXL-N region for lensing-based mass calibration, and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature and luminosity measurements used to constrain scaling relations. Using the density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) algorithm, we construct a forward model with 12 parameters that incorporates the XXL selection function and cluster population modeling and accounts for key systematic effects including cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias. Our SBI analysis yields a constraint on the cosmological parameter $S_8 \\equiv σ_8 (Ω_{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \\pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity. The result is consistent with Planck and recent cluster-based measurements. The inferred temperature-mass relation is consistent with self-similar expectations within uncertainties, whereas the luminosity-temperature relation exhibits a slope steeper than the self-similar prediction. From the resulting posterior distribution of the forward model, we derive lensing-calibrated mass estimates for all individual XXL clusters with measured X-ray temperatures or luminosities. These results provide a self-consistent mass calibration for future multi-probe cosmological analyses of the XXL sample."}

When the first astrochemical models including solid-state chemistry were developed more than forty years ago, data from dedicated laboratory experiments were limited.

We want to demonstrate whether it is possible to use rate-equation-type astrochemical models developed in the context of the Interstellar Medium to compare them with laboratory astrophysics experiments. In this work, we use the case of low-temperature hydrogenation of CO, which is known to lead to methanol, among other molecules. We carried out 9 experiments, varying the experimental parameters such as temperature and dose. We give quantitative results and take care of detailing the vocabulary used in the experiments. We use astrochemical codes, NAUTILUS, pyRate and MONACO, to reproduce our experimental conditions, which requires good control of the change of vocabulary and scales, especially for fluxes and time scales. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use different astrochemical codes to compare modelling results directly with the output of experiments. There are discrepancies between models and experiments, as well as between models, but a fair agreement is achieved. We discuss the possible origin of the differences, which could originate from the chemical network or the difference in the description of physical processes."}

An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \\textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics."}

We then employ neural posterior estimation to constrain the scalar field mass ($m_φ$), the cosmic birefringence amplitude ($gφ_\\mathrm{in}/2$), and the instrumental miscalibration angle ($α$), from simulated datasets. We find that the posterior on $m_φ$ shows two regimes, with a transition marked by $10^{-32}$ eV, highlighting a strong sensitivity to the scale dependence of cosmic birefringence. To quantify this behavior, we compute the probability $p(m_φ < 10^{-32}$\\,eV) for various fiducial values of $m_φ$.

Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling."}

Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws."}

In this work, we forecast the constraining power of a joint analysis combining fiducial data from a Stage-IV WL survey with measurements of the dispersion measure from fast radio bursts (FRBs). We evaluate the ability of this approach to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the astrophysical processes governing baryonic feedback, and we quantify the impact of key FRB systematics, including redshift uncertainties and source clustering.

This note explores these assumptions by computing correction terms in powers of $m/E$ up to order $(m/E)^4$. The assumptions are found to be robust: not only is the leading correction quadratic in $m/E$, but also cancellations reduce its coefficient and that of the next-to-leading correction, which is of order $(m/E)^4$. Three- and four-particle systems are also treated and the generalisation to larger numbers of particles indicated.

For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs."}

Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Resolved metallicity studies of local disk galaxies have revealed that their interstellar media (ISMs) are far from chemically homogeneous, displaying significant ($\\sim 0.05$ dex) variations in the metallicity on characteristic scales of a few hundred parsecs. Such data is at odds with most analytical models, where the ISM is predicted to be more well-mixed. Here, we suggest that the observed small-scale features seen in galaxies may be superbubbles of metal-enriched gas created by a collection of core collapse supernovae with tight spatial (and temporal) correlation. In this scenario, the size of the metallicity fluctuations (superbubble radius, $φ$) is set by the disk scale height of the galaxy in question (after which point shock breakout favours preferential expansion along directions perpendicular to the dense disc), and the amount of additional metals contained within a fluctuation is proportional to the star formation efficiency in superbubble regions ($ε$). To test this theory, we analysed metallicity maps from the PHANGS-MUSE sample of galaxies using a geostatistical forward-modelling approach. We find $φ\\simeq 300$ pc and $ε= 0.1-0.2$, in good agreement with our theoretical model. Further, these small-scale parameters are found to be related to the global galaxy properties, suggesting that the local structure of the interstellar medium of galaxies is not universal. Such a model of star formation paints a new picture of galaxy evolution in the modern universe: in large local galaxies, star formation appears steady and regular when averaged over large scales. However, on small scales, these large galaxies remain intrinsically bursty like their smaller, high-redshift counterparts."}

Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\\rm obs}$/L$_{\\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more \"preventive\" than \"ejective\"."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $ξ_{21,ν}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $ξ_{21,ν}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $ξ_{21,ν}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization."}

We find that dimensionless observables such as the entropy density $s/T^3$, the pressure $P/T^4$, the energy density $\\varepsilon/T^4$, the trace anomaly $Δ= (\\varepsilon - 3P)/T^4$, and the specific heat at constant volume $C_V/T^3$ are sensitive to both finite magnetic field and chemical potential. As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior. Finally, we compare our results with the lattice QCD data for the quadratic fluctuations of conserved charges and their correlations. The model successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of these observables at $eB=0$ and 0.04 GeV$^2$. However, at the stronger field strength $eB=0.14$ GeV$^2$, the model underestimates the magnitudes while still capturing the overall temperature trend."}

We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations."}

The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes. Our quasars have host stellar mass measurements from JWST, allowing us to compare them with the LAE overdensity around galaxies without quasar activity with comparable stellar masses.

One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy.

Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact.

Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations."}

Among the selected applications, we highlight the state-of-the-art prediction $Γ(B \\rightarrow X_u \\ell \\barν_{\\ell}) = \\frac{|V_{ub}|^2}{|3.82\\times 10^{-3}|^2}\\,\\big( 6.53 \\,\\pm 0.12 \\, \\pm 0.13\\, \\pm 0.03\\, \\big) \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{GeV}\\,$ derived in the kinetic-mass scheme. We report several notable observations regarding the convergence of the first three orders of QCD corrections to the $q^2$-spectrum and to inclusive moments of the lepton-energy spectrum in semi-leptonic weak decays of $b$- and $c$-quark in different quark-mass schemes; they are important both for improving the inclusive determinations of the relevant CKM elements, non-perturbative dynamical parameters, and for gaining new insights into the potential impact of high-order QCD corrections. Lastly we discuss a novel interesting point encountered in the consistent perturbative reformulation of the differential $q^2$-spectrum from the pole-mass to other mass schemes: certain boundary-effect terms are identified that are non-vanishing for $b \\rightarrow u \\ell \\barν_{\\ell}$ firstly at $\\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$; their incorporation is essential to preserve the integrity of the integrated moments of the perturbatively re-expanded $q^2$-spectrum but necessitates histogramming from $\\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ onward even within pure perturbation theory."}

Models of the Galactic electron density are thus widely used to predict distances and scattering of compact radio sources (including pulsars, fast radio bursts (FRBs), and long-period transients), in addition to mitigating ISM foregrounds in Galactic and extragalactic studies. We use a sample of 171 precise pulsar distances, based entirely on parallaxes and globular cluster associations, as well as scattering measurements of 568 pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and masers, to update the NE2001 Galactic electron density model. We refit the thick and thin disks and three of the spiral arms. The new parameters for these large-scale components significantly repartition free electrons between the thick disk and spiral arms, thereby correcting NE2001's systematic underestimation of pulsar distance and scattering. Sightlines with excessive dispersion and scattering are used to identify new clumps that are added to the model, in addition to refining clumps that were already included (e.g., Cygnus, Vela, and Gum). The Galactic Center component is revised, yielding scattering time predictions that are $10^3$ times smaller than the Galactic Center in NE2001. The updated model, NE2025, provides a factor of $20\\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy and $100\\%$ median improvement in scattering predictions based on DM, relative to NE2001. There is a $15\\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy relative to YMW16. NE2025 is available on Github and the Python Package Interface."}

In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes."}

Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation."}

Consequently, future prospects could probe new physics whose contribution to the electron EDM first arises at three-loop order. Additional SU(2)$_L$ multiplets with CP-violating Yukawa interactions, which contribute to the electron EDM at three-loop level, is one such testable new physics scenario. In this scenario, the electron EDM is radiatively induced from two contributions: the CP-odd trilinear $W$-boson coupling, called the electroweak-Weinberg operator, and the CP-odd dipole operator of electron. The former and the latter operators are generated at two-loop and three-loop levels, respectively, after integrating out the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. Within the same models, according to an analysis based on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we previously found that the contribution to the electron EDM from the electroweak-Weinberg operator can be probed in future experiments. However, the one-loop matching condition between the electron EDM and the electroweak-Weinberg operator does not receive a large logarithmic enhancement because the associated anomalous dimension is zero. The CP-odd dipole operator of the electron would contribute to the electron EDM at the same three-loop order as the contribution through the electroweak-Weinberg operator. In this paper, we directly calculate the electron EDM induced by the CP-violating Yukawa interactions of the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets at full three-loop level. A central result is that the full three-loop calculation is a factor of three larger than that of the electroweak-Weinberg operator alone."}

In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm -- originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension -- which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-$z$ galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies.

These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches."}

By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=λφ^4$ and $V=μφχ+ λφ^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime."}

That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \\textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics."}

Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact.

A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $σ$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $ρ$- and $ω$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. We demonstrate that these parameter sets also successfully describe the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ without further tuning. For the three-body system, our results indicate that an $I\\left(J^P\\right)=1 / 2\\left(0^{-}\\right)$ three-body molecular bound state exists when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state located within approximately $-10~\\text{MeV}$ of the $D\\bar{D}^*$ threshold.

We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology."}

However, their rarity makes environmental trends difficult to establish. We use the FLAMINGO simulation, which simultaneously reproduces the redshift distribution and number counts of SMGs. We use the DisPerSE to identify filamentary structures at $z=4$, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments.

The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\\%$ in low-density regions."}

Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter.

In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $NΔ$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry.

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys."}

The minimal UED (mUED) framework being highly predictive is strongly constrained by the combined requirements of relic density and collider searches under standard cosmological assumptions. We revisit the dark matter phenomenology of mUED in the presence of a nonstandard cosmological history featuring a low reheating temperature driven by prolonged inflaton decay. Solving the coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, we show that entropy injection during reheating can dilute the relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reopening large regions of parameter space previously ruled out.

Comments welcome", "summary": "We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $ξ_{21,ν}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $ξ_{21,ν}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $ξ_{21,ν}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization."}

In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12).

This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \\times L_t=48^3\\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_π=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature.

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations."}

Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity."}

We derive projected constraints on the primordial black hole population from a null detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by these experiments, including the impact of the electroweak phase transition on the abundance of planetary-mass primordial black holes. We also discuss the connection between the obtained projected constraints and the recent microlensing observations by the HSC collaboration of the Andromeda Galaxy."}
