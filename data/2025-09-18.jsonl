We quantify their\nimpact on the recovery of mass density profile parameters using 967 clusters\nfrom the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation. We construct mock weak lensing\nmaps, including both single source plane mocks and Euclid-like mocks with a\nrealistic source redshift distribution. Applying Bayesian inference with\nNautilus, we fit spherical and elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White models to recover\nthe cluster mass, concentration, axis ratio, and centre, which we use to\nmeasure the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) offset from the potential centre, or\n`BCG wobble'. We find that the spherical model fits clusters along under-dense\nsight-lines better than those along over-dense ones. This introduces a positive\nskew in the relative error distributions for mass and concentration, which\nincreases with source redshift. In Euclid-like mocks, this results in a mean\nmass bias of $+5.3\\pm1.4$% (significant at $3.5\\sigma$) when assuming a\nspherical NFW model. We also detect a mean axis ratio bias of $-2.0\\pm0.7$%\n($2.9\\sigma$), with no significant bias in concentration. We measure a BCG\nwobble of ~14 kpc in our Euclid-like mocks, with negligible contribution from\nline-of-sight structure. Furthermore, we predict the scatter in mass estimates\nfrom future weak lensing surveys that have mean source redshifts $z_\\text s\n\\gtrsim 1.2$ (such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope), will be dominated\nby line-of-sight structure and hence assuming a diagonal covariance matrix will\nlead to overestimating the precision. We conclude that cluster weak lensing\npipelines should be calibrated on simulations with lightcone data in order to\nproperly account for the significant impact of line-of-sight structure."}

However, in massive mergers,\nintegrals of motion are not strictly conserved, redistributing accreted stars\nacross dynamical spaces, such as energy-angular momentum ($E-L_z$).\nAdditionally, the in situ disc becomes kinematically heated, acquiring\nhalo-like orbits.

This study aims\nat quantifying this contamination in known accreted halo substructures. As they\nare defined by kinematics, we aim at cleaning their samples analysing only\nchemical properties. We applied the kinematic selection criteria for the halo\nsubstructures to the Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE DR17 data. Then we adopted a Gaussian\nMixture Model approach to chemically compare different substructures on a\nstar-by-star basis, taking into account several abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn,\nAl, and C). We argue that the chemical properties of Sequoia point towards a\nshared origin with GSE.

Besides these two\npopulations, we identified stars with chemical and orbital properties\ncompatible with Sagittarius in the Helmi Stream and with $\\omega$ Cen in\nThamnos. Finally, GSE itself is contaminated by Sagittarius.

In the\nscalar-tensor representation, this construction yields a hilltop-type potential\nin the Jordan frame, which maps to an exponential potential in the Einstein\nframe. To account for radiative effects, we introduce a logarithmic correction\nto the Einstein-frame potential inspired by one-loop effective field theory,\nproducing a late-time flattening without requiring fine-tuning. The resulting\nscalaron dynamics reduce the effective mass to O(H_0), inducing a thawing\nregime that deviates from a cosmological constant at the sub-percent levels. A\njoint background likelihood analysis using Pantheon+SH0ES and BAO+CC datasets\n(within the CPL parametrization) yields H_0 = 73.4+-0.6 km/s/Mpc and Omega_m =\n0.253+-0.007, consistent with local expansion rate measurements.

At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H\nII regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter,\nsuggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or\nhydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction\ndeclines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting\nless efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments.

Our results indicate\nthat the non-minimal coupling parameter $\\xi$ must be non-positive, and the\nlower bound on the Lorentz-violating parameter $\\xi b^2$ is constrained to be\non the order of $10^{-15}$. Gravitational waves in Bumblebee model are found to\npropagate in two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one mixed scalar mode.\nNotably, the tensor gravitational waves travel at subluminal speeds, whereas\nthe vector and scalar gravitational waves propagate at superluminal speeds.\nThese results provide a concrete theoretical framework and specific\nobservational signatures for testing Lorentz invariance in the gravitational\nsector with future gravitational-wave detectors."}

In this work, we develop a\ngeneral framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity\nand the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial\nconstraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our\npath integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in\nperturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.\n  As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of\ngravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are\nnon-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known\nOpen Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it\nto include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the\nmost general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation.\nRemarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is\ndissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at\nhigher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case.

Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to\nconstrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies.

We achieve this using the soft effective action,\nwhich characterizes the low-energy gravitational degrees of freedom that arise\nin the long-distance limit of the Einstein-Hilbert action and consists of both\nthe soft graviton mode and the Goldstone mode arising from the spontaneous\nbreaking of supertranslation symmetry. Integrating out the soft graviton mode,\nwe obtain an effective action for purely the Goldstone mode, from which we\nextract the density matrix and therefore the modular Hamiltonian $K_{s}$\nassociated to the vacuum state. We explicitly compute the mean and variance of\n$K_{s}$, finding $\\langle \\Delta K_{s}^{2} \\rangle =\nA/\\epsilon_{\\text{UV}}^{2}$, with $\\epsilon_{\\text{UV}}$ being a length-scale\nUV cutoff on the celestial sphere."}

One\nconsistent approach is via detector-based measurements. We study the effects of\nsuch measurements in a CFT with a holographic dual. We work out the boundary\nspace-time regions associated to a L\\\"{u}ders update and how the outcome\nextends to modifications of the bulk gravity state.

We formalize\nthis as the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC) which is the statement that in\nany UV complete quantum gravity, black hole and cosmological horizon\nthermodynamics are generically inequivalent. The BKE criterion is then\nformulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the\nconjecture. Finally, we propose an observational scaling test which is centered\naround comparisons of data native entropy proxies from tomographic maps to the\nBekenstein Hawking prediction. The framework both sharpens when and why the\narea law holds and provides a roadmap towards a UV complete description of\ncosmological horizon entropy."}

The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be\nlarge at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter\ndistance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics\napproximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation.\nAssuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the\ncurvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter\ndistance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics\napproximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the\napproximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects\nbecome large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature\nspikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further\nwork."}

Today's mirror stabilization control injects\nharmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We\neliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning\nmethod using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO\nLivingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the\n10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design\ngoal motivated by the quantum limit.
