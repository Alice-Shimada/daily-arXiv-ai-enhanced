We demonstrate this finding in two independent\nsimulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf\ngalaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings\nsuggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best\npredicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse\nregions expanding to their cooling radii on large (\\sim kpc) scales, while\ndense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\\sim pc) manner.\nHowever, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high\nnumerical resolutions capable of following scales <<10^3 \\msun. On larger\nscales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local\nenvironments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical\nimplications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation\n(Mptcl. \\sim 200 \\msun) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model. The\ncoarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a given\nSN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation,\nsuggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation\nthrough hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar\nfeedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved\nISM."}

These anomalies are often attributed to\ndark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a\nsignificant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common\nfeature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic\nanalysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga\ncosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of\nthese galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields\nsmooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating\nnumerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the\nflux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical\ncusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars,\nwe use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region.\nOur primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between\nthe magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even\nFourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole\ncomponents show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with\nSpearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order\nof 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are\nhighly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We\nconclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic\nbar's complex morphology.

This breaking leads to the\nemergence of the scoto-seesaw mechanism and a $Z_2$ symmetry. This naturally\nexplains the solar and atmospheric mass-squared differences, $\\Delta\nm_{sol}^{2}$ and $\\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$, while simultaneously ensuring dark\nmatter stability. Our model accommodates normal ordering of neutrino masses,\nwith a generalized $\\mu$-$\\tau$ reflection symmetry shaping the structure of\nleptonic mixing and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Moreover, the\nmodel provides predictions for the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and a strong\ncorrelation between $\\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$. This\ncorrelation puts a lower bound on the fermionic DM mass. In contrast, scalar\ndark matter remains viable over a broad mass spectrum. A notable feature is\nthat the low mass regime ($\\sim 15$ GeV onwards) survives owing to the presence\nof efficient co-annihilation channels, which are typically absent in the\nMajorana scotogenic scenario. Additionally, the model aligns with current and\nfuture limits from lepton flavor violation experiments."}

The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as\nit serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of\nturbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and\nintermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF\ngalaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54\ngalaxies at z<0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853,\n[FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from\nW80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line\nratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin\nof the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the\nlargest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less\nturbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity\ndispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the\nnucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward\nincrease up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display\nincreasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line\nratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most\nturbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We\nspeculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and\njet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be\ncreated by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an\nimportant mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from\ncooling and forming new stars."}

Our\n400 MHz images capture in fine detail the radio-morphology of the XRGs, as well\nas other serendipitous radio-sources located in these fields. We use these\nimages along with archival low-frequencyand high-frequency radio data to\ninvestigate the spectral properties of the XRGs 4C32.25 and 4C61.23. Under the\nassumption of conditions corresponding to the maximum radio-source age, we\nestimate the spectral ages of both the primary lobes and the wings.

Moreover, we have used the radio images available to\nderive high-resolution spectral index maps for these two XRGs.

We followed the dynamical\nevolution of the system up to a final separation of four Schwarzschild radii.\nThe black holes were added as special relativistic particles and their equation\nof motion contains a full post-Newtonian approximation - 2.5 term. Results.\nInitially, the black holes are not gravitationally bound and, thus, the system\nspends more than 60 Myr in the phase of dynamical friction while tightening the\norbit. The two-body scattering phase takes place from 60 Myr up to 120 Myr. In\nthe last 10 Myr, the black hole's separation is seen to be rapidly shrinking\ndue to the gravitational wave emission. Starting from the physical separation\nobserved today, the total merging time in our model is 130 (10) Myr.\nConclusions. These results have implications for the statistics of strong\nsources of gravitational waves at low frequencies, namely, systems engaged in\nan advanced state of are expected to be prime sources for the LISA mission to\nobserve."}

This study aims to examine the emission\ncharacteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D\ndynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz\nwere computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized\nemissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to\nreflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from\nthese RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different\nlocations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are\nstrongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features\nlike wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial\nindicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in\nGRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary\nstructures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr.\nHigh-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon\ndistances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the\ninterpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the\nlateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a\ngradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study\nhighlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a\nstatistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of\nindividual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter\nentrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs.\nThe diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing\nturbulence in the cocoon."}

Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e.\nco-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been\nproposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute\npotentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the\nproperties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass\ngalaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central\nlate-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\\rm tot} \\approx 10^{12}$, $D/T>0.5$, $N_{\\rm\nstar}>10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar\nparticles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity\n$\\epsilon < -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main\ndisk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star\nformation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host\nsignificant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\\% of the total stellar mass of\nthe disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from\nobservations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\\%),\nin-situ dominated (i.e.73\\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often\ncoincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations\nare able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star\npopulation is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways\ncan lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth\naccretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare\nbut diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the\naccretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow,\nsuggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past\naccretion history."}

Starting from\nthe derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between\nthe equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only\nweakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density.
