Previous studies have suggested that\nseveral MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of\nsatellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given\nthat many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In\nthis work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole\ndistribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For\na sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d<100$ kpc we find that\nthe pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we\nsubtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower\ndistance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the\nstreams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction\nsimilar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole\ndistribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the\norbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole\ndistribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample,\nwe infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to\nbe affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical\nsimulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common\norigin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated\nuntil the selected sample also includes material at $d \\gtrsim 150$ kpc."}

Without demanding\nrepeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies\nand generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces\ncomputation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent\nprediction accuracy of 99.93\\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional\nparameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK.\nOur LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to\nenable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global\n21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR."}

Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems\nwhose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very\npromising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this\nwork, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant\nformalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account\nfor the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings\nwith external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the\n(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when\nattainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in\nterms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When\nthis decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even\nwith couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We\nthen apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of\nquantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)\ncharged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our\nclocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix\n$\\rho_{\\tau_2|\\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields\nnot only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical\nexpected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum\nfluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile."}

Two CO surveys are analyzed\nwith the standard CO conversion factor. The main results are: (1) For each\nsurvey the cloud virial parameter $\\alpha_{vir}$ increases by a factor ~2 from\ngalactocentric radius $R_{gal}$ = 4 kpc to 15 kpc. (2) PVE models match these\ntrends only if the surface densities of survey clouds and nearby stars are\ncomparable. This evidence of environmental influence resembles that seen in\nother disk galaxies. (3) Many survey clouds form stars even though their virial\nparameter exceeds the critical value $\\alpha_{vir}\\approx2$. In PVE such clouds\nwith constant velocity dispersion have stable equilibrium and cannot form stars\nby simple global collapse. (4) However, simulations show that\n$\\alpha_{vir}\\approx2$ clouds with dissipating turbulence may form filaments,\ncores and protostars with little global contraction. Such clouds can match the\nMW star formation rate if their protostellar cores have mass fraction\n~10$^{-3}$. A simple model predicts that the star-forming age of a cloud is\nproportional to the ratio of its YSOs to its mass. (5) Clouds within ~500 pc of\nthe Sun are predicted to have star-forming ages 1-10 Myr and average YSO age ~2\nMyr, matching evolutionary models.

Going beyond the weak-field regime,\nwe find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop\nimaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of\nvacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the\nanomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy\ntensor in the conformally coupled case."}

Cline"], "title": "Dark Sector Electroweak Baryogenesis In Light Of The Galactic Center Excess", "comment": "19 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter\ncandidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon\nasymmetry in a dark sector. The model can successfully explain the baryon\nasymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma\nrays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition\ninduced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be\nobserved in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in\ndirect detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible\ndecay width."}

IceCube also measures the atmospheric\nmuon neutrino flux at high energy. Since this is dominated by the astrophysical\nflux, they are only able to set an upper bound on the prompt atmospheric muon\nneutrino flux contribution. We provide a new evaluation of the prompt\natmospheric muon flux including for the first time an intrinsic charm component\nto colliding nucleons. This increases forward production of $\\bar{D}^{0}$,\n$D^-$ and $\\Lambda_c$ which decay into final states that can contain muons and\nmuon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to\nintrinsic charm has an associated increase in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We\nconsider the Regge ansatz for intrinsic charm production that we implement in\nMCEq used for the calculation of the lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges\nof obtaining predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's\nhigh energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and their upper bound on the\nprompt muon neutrino flux. We quantify the discrepancies."}

We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired,\nfive-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification,\nobtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are\ntreated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is\nencoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic\nand fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \\sim\n\\Lambda_{\\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\\Lambda_{\\text{EM}} \\gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 =\n\\frac{3\\pi^2 m_e v}{4\\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \\Lambda_{\\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied,\nthe leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large\n$R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative\napproach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to\ndetermine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically\nsupports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as\ngravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the\nstudy of stopping power and particle range."}
