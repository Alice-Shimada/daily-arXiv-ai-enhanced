Invited review in the Perspective section of the\n  journal Research", "summary": "Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for\ncomputing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first\nprinciples using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field\ntheory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion\nand perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables --\nquasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in\nlattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon\nresummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates\nhigher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative\nand power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical\nuncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further\nsimplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative\nregion. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton\nobservables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently\nproposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access\nto unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios,\nwhich will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power\ncorrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state\ncontamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions,\nare expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state\nisolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have\nentered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement,\nwhich will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments."}

With respect to its predecessor,\nPUCHEROS + includes a substantial number of improvements, mainly: a new\nscientific detector, improved objective optics, calibration system, guiding,\nactive thermal control, and remote observing mode. These upgrades convert our\nearly prototype into a much more powerful instrument for science. With a\nspectral resolution of R = 18000, a spectral range between 400 and 730 nm and\nan instrument efficiency of about 30 per cent, PUCHEROS + was tested at the ESO\n(European Southern Observatory) 1.52-m telescope where it has reached a\nlimiting magnitude of about 12 in V band and radial velocity precision of about\n30 m/s. The instrument was conceived as a pathfinder for the high-resolution\nechelle spectrograph PLATOSpec and at the same time, it demonstrates that a\ncompact, relatively low-cost spectrograph can be efficiently employed for\nlong-term monitoring campaigns and as support facility for space missions, in\nparticular if operated remotely at relatively small- or medium-sized\ntelescopes."}

We perform new spectral energy distribution fits\nincorporating mid- and far-IR photometry to test whether dust-obscured star\nformation can explain this trend. We find that while allowing for buried star\nformation can raise star formation rates by $\\sim0.5$ dex, for almost all\ngalaxies it is neither required to fit the observed IR SED, nor is it\nsufficient to explain the observed depletion trend. Even the combination of\nsignificant buried star formation and ULIRG-like $\\alpha_{CO}$ is not enough to\nexplain this decay in CO luminosity.

AO systems require wavefront sensors (WFSs) that measure the phase\nof the incoming light in order to reconstruct optical aberrations. However,\nmost WFSs used for sensing atmospheric turbulence cannot correctly detect\naberrations induced by misalignments in segmented telescopes, as they show poor\nsensitivity to phase discontinuities. We investigate the potential of photonic\nlanterns (PLs), which are waveguides that allow for the low-loss transmission\nfrom multi-mode to multiple single-mode optical signals, for sensing segment\nmisalignments at the focal plane. We assess the ability of PLs to measure\npiston offsets in segmented mirrors through both simulations and laboratory\nexperiments.

The first new ingredient is the\nexplicit addition of a unitarity filter applied to a given known set of input\ndata for the hadronic form factors. This further constraint is not usually\ntaken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL\n$z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach\nfully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes\nhadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative\nway. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable\nkernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the\napplication of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever\ndata and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be\nuseful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of\nthe electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak\nsemileptonic decays of hadrons.

The upcoming NASA SMEX satellite mission\nCompton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI), scheduled for launch in 2027, is\nexpected to break through this limitation with its Compton telescope utilizing\na germanium semiconductor detector, covering the 0.2-5 MeV energy range.

This further constraint is not usually\ntaken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL\n$z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach\nfully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes\nhadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative\nway. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable\nkernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the\napplication of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever\ndata and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be\nuseful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of\nthe electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak\nsemileptonic decays of hadrons.

By including the\nmost numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless\nspectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy;\nB) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic\nvariance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range\nfrom 1.0--2.3 $\\mu$m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple\ndiagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening;\nD) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal\ngrism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping\nspectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST\nfollowup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver\nfully-processed high-level data products.\n  In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and\npresent examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest\nin the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low\nmasses."}

Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects\nanalogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space,\nconsistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a\nreflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the\nfield and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the\nUnruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary,\nthe relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB\nis placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly\neliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a\ncharacteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the\ndistance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the\nboundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect\nbecomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath.\nConversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect\nweakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our\nfindings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum\nfluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights\nfor optimizing QB performance. This work paves the way for the development of\nhigh-efficiency quantum energy storage systems in the relativistic framework."}

The heavy-flavor\nhadrons are produced initially during heavy-ion or hadronic collisions and are\none of the best probes to understand the initial stages of the collisions as\nwell as the system evolution. In experiments, the heavy-flavor sectors are\nstudied directly via their decay to different hadrons or di-leptons or via\ntheir semi-leptonic decay, which is accompanied by additional neutrinos.\nHowever, their measurement in experiments is resource-intensive and requires\ninput from different Monte-Carlo event generators.

This work tests whether this\ntension can be resolved solely by modifying the cosmological background,\nwithout invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early\ngalaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an\nanti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises\nin quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure\nformation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy\nevolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of\nobservations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV\nluminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with\nwell-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift\nprobes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these\nconstraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to\nreproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at $z > 10$. While these models\nremain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is\nthat this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to\nexplain the galaxy excess.

For each case, we identify the existence and stability of\nequilibrium points, classify their cosmological behavior, and compute key\nobservables such as the deceleration parameter and effective equation of state.\nOur results reveal that the theory admits matter-dominated eras,\nparameter-dependent saddle solutions, and stable de Sitter attractors capable\nof driving late-time cosmic acceleration. The additional scalar degree of\nfreedom introduced by the non-coincident gauge plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the system's dynamics and viability. These findings emphasize the\npotential of scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity as a robust extension of\ngeneral relativity and motivate further confrontation of the model with\nobservational data."}

Azimuthal offsets between molecular gas\nand star formation are expected if gas crosses spiral arms, as predicted by\nquasi-stationary density wave theory. In this work, we measure offsets between\nCO and Halpha peaks in radial bins for 24 galaxies from the PHANGS survey that\ndisplay a well-delineated spiral structure. The offsets exhibit substantial\nscatter, implying that star formation is not exclusively initiated at a\ncoherent spiral shock. We define offsets such that positive values mean Halpha\npeaks lie ahead of CO peaks in the direction of galactic rotation. With this\nconvention, 14 galaxies show mean positive CO-Halpha offsets, typically of a\nfew hundred parsecs. In four of these 14 galaxies (17% of the total), offsets\nbecome smaller with increasing radius, as expected for a single\nquasi-stationary spiral density wave. Ten galaxies (42%) show positive mean\noffsets but no clear correlation with radius, which is compatible with multiple\noverlapping modes. In the remaining ten galaxies (42%), we find no\nsignificantly positive offsets, which could point to transient dynamical\nspirals or material arms, where gas and stars co-rotate with the spiral\nperturbation. Across the full sample, we find mostly positive offsets between\nCO peaks and the gravitational potential minimum, confirming that gas often\ncrosses the spiral perturbation. For the four galaxies with clear positive\noffsets and a radial trend, we derived pattern speeds in good agreement with\nthe literature. Overall, our results suggest that even well-delineated spirals\nin the local Universe can arise from a variety of underlying dynamical\nmechanisms."}

In this scenario, ancient ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs,\n$L_V\\leq10^{5}L_{\\odot}$) would have been the first to reach this condition in\nthe history of the Local Group. Conversely, if planets form for\n${\\rm[Fe/H]}\\geq-0.6$ then they should not exist in UFDs, while only\n$\\approx0.001\\%-0.1\\%$ of stars in dSphs with $L_V\\geq3\\times10^{5}L_{\\odot}$\nwould host planets dwelling in safe conditions for long times. Interestingly,\nwe find a \"luminosity sweet spot\" at $L_V\\sim10^{6}L_{\\odot}$ where dSphs in\nour sample safely host terrestrial planets up to $4$ Gyr and in any planet\nformation scenario explored. In conclusion, planet formation at low metallicity\nis key to understanding which types of galaxies might have formed Earth-like\nplanets that dwelt unexposed to galactic threats over several billions of\nyears, first in the history of the Local Group."}

In this work, we therefore explore the quantization of\nTeukolsky scalars on Kerr. We demonstrate that the theory can be written in\nterms of a formally hermitian Green-hyperbolic operator, allowing the\nconstruction of the algebra of observables. The reconstruction scheme for the\nmetric perturbation allows us to keep track of the physical subalgebra.

However, previous studies have assumed that the halos in which the\nsatellites orbit are composed solely of dark matter, neglecting the role of\nbaryons. Here, we develop an analytical model incorporating stars, gas, and the\nadiabatic response of dark matter to assess the impact of baryonic effects on\nthe inference from satellite kinematics. The model covers halos in the mass\nrange $10^{12}-10^{15}M_\\odot$ and is tuned to agree with well-established\nobservational scaling relations. In addition, the model uses simple functional\nforms for the mass fractions of ejected baryons and diffuse halo stars,\ncalibrated to the median trends in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. We\nfind that baryonic effects mainly result in a reduction of the satellite\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion due to the ejection of baryons and the\nresulting response of the dark matter halo. The effect is minimal (less than\n1%) for the most massive halos, but reaches ~5-6% for halos in the mass range\n$10^{12}-10^{13}M_\\odot$, and up to 8% in extreme cases. We propose a simple\nformalism for correcting the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion for\nbaryonic effects, and for marginalizing over the uncertainties. We integrate\nthis correction function into BASILISK, a Bayesian hierarchical inference\nmethod applied to satellite kinematics data extracted from large redshift\nsurveys, and find that this shifts central galaxies to higher inferred halo\nmasses at fixed luminosity by up to ~0.3 dex.

Astrophysical modeling uncertainties further\ncomplicate matters, leaving the relative amplitudes of the map components\npoorly understood. In this paper, we present a neural-network (NN) approach to\nseparate the three map components at the level of the angular power spectrum,\nexplicitly accounting for uncertainties in their relative amplitudes. As test\ncases, we generate SPHEREx-like maps with variable interloper line luminosities\nacross multiple frequency channels, with and without pixel-wise scatter and\ncontinuum contributions. We find that cross-channel correlations are essential\nfor robust NN performance when scatter is present. The NN exhibits a hierarchy\nin residual errors: brighter components yield smaller residuals, and the\ndimmest the highest. Without continuum emission, the network recovers the\ntarget power spectrum to within $2.5\\%$, while partially correcting the\ninterloper spectra. With continuum included, the NN accurately reconstructs the\npower spectra of the continuum and target line, within $2\\%$ and $6\\%$,\nrespectively, but fails to recover those of the interlopers.

With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line\nfluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We\nfind that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts,\nbecoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between\nattenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar\nmass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av.\nWe find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with\nincreasing redshift.

The highest redshift\ngalaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous\nstudies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV\nobscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by\nas large as an order of magnitude.

Recent advances in\nlattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon\nresummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates\nhigher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative\nand power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical\nuncertainties.

We adopt a model to\npredict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density\nof stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole\nmass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of\ngalactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and\nmasses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may\nbe a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed\nhypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary\nstar interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced\nin this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active\ngrowth channel for the LMC's black hole."}

Using this larger\nand more spatially extended sample, we provide updated constraints on Boo I's\nsystemic properties, including its radial population gradients. Properly\naccounting for perspective rotation effects in a UFD for the first time, we\ndetect a $4\\sigma$ line-of-sight velocity gradient of $1.2\\pm0.3$ km s$^{-1}$\n$r_h^{-1}$ aligned along Boo I's orbit and discuss its potential tidal origins.\nWe also infer a metallicity gradient of $-0.10\\pm0.02$ dex $r_h^{-1}$ in\nagreement with previous studies. Using an axisymmetric Jeans model, we provide\nupdated constraints on Boo I's dark matter density profile, which weakly favor\na cusped ($\\gamma=1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$) dark matter profile.

Here, we show that radiation\npressure from Ly$\\alpha$ photons produced in the pre-SN phase can instead erase\nfeedback-free conditions, and severely limit the star formation efficiency\n(SFE). We find that, for a constant star formation rate, all clouds with gas\nsurface density $(37-1.7 \\times 10^5)\\ M_\\odot\\ \\rm pc^{-2}$ have $\\epsilon_* <\n0.08$. Higher SFE values can only be reached if Ly$\\alpha$-driven shells\nfragment and form stars.

The QB is driven by an\nexternal classical force acting as a charger. A major challenge in this setup\nis the environment-induced decoherence, which leads to energy dissipation of\nthe QB. Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects\nanalogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space,\nconsistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a\nreflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the\nfield and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the\nUnruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary,\nthe relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB\nis placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly\neliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a\ncharacteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the\ndistance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the\nboundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect\nbecomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath.\nConversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect\nweakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our\nfindings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum\nfluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights\nfor optimizing QB performance.

We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an\nanti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises\nin quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure\nformation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy\nevolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of\nobservations.

By demonstrating the\nlimitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case\nthat evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving\nthe challenge of early galaxy formation."}

To\naccount for topology change, one is led to allow the creation and annihilation\nof closed and open universes in a framework often called third quantization or\nuniverse field theory. We argue that since topology change in gravity is a rare\nevent, its contribution to exponentially late-time physics is universally\ndescribed by a Poisson process. This universal Poisson process is responsible\nfor the plateau in the multi-boundary generalization of the spectral form\nfactor at late times. In the Fock space of closed baby universes, this\nuniversality implies that the statistics of the total number of baby universes\nis captured by a coherent state. Allowing for the creation of asymptotic open\nuniverses calls for a noncommutative generalization of a Poisson process. We\npropose such an operator algebraic framework, called Poissonization, which\ntakes as input the observable algebra and a (unnormalized) state of a quantum\nsystem and outputs a von Neumann algebra of a many-body theory represented on\nits symmetric Fock space. Physically, Poissonization is a generalization of the\ncoherent state vacua of bipartite quantum systems or matrix quantum mechanics.\nThe multi-boundary correlators of the Marolf-Maxfield toy model of baby\nuniverses, and the sum over bordisms of closed-open 2D topological quantum\nfield theory, are entirely captured by Poissonization. In the\nJackiew-Teitelboim gravity, the universal Poisson process reproduces the\nlate-time correlators in the $\\tau$-scaling limit."}

The issue is edited by Matt Griffin and Naseem Rangwala (JATIS VOL.\n  11, NO. 3 | July 2025)", "summary": "We present the architectural concept for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey\nSpectrometer (FIRESS) for the Probe Mission for far-IR Astrophysics (PRIMA).\nFIRESS spans the 24--235 micron range with four R ~ 100 slit-fed grating\nmodules, each coupling to a 24 (spatial) by 84 (spectral) pixel array of\nkinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). All four arrays are read out\nsimultaneously, and a point source of interest can be coupled to two of the\nfour bands at a time. A Fourier transform module can be engaged over a portion\nof the FIRESS slits to create a high-resolution mode in which the light is\nintercepted, processed by the interferometer then reinserted into the path to\nthe grating modules for detection. We provide a simulation and description of\nthe technique that will be used to obtain high-resolution spectra. We identify\nthe most important system requirements imposed by the detector system, finding\nthat they are met with the existing design. Finally, we present our performance\nmodeling, including both direct estimates given our current design status, as\nwell as durable guidelines for developing general-observer programs."}
