The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $φ^I$ and an invariant $b = \\sqrt{\\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $κ$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = κ/\\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $τ(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $Hτ(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \\sim H_\\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \\varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $Λ$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $κ\\ \\simeq \\ \\varepsilon \\ \\simeq \\ 1/3$ and $H_\\star/H_0 \\ \\simeq \\ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements."}

This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure.

The first-order coefficients, $S_1(j)$, quantify scale-dependent variance analogous to the power spectrum, while the normalized second-order ratio $R(j_1,j_2)=S_2/S_1$ captures non-Gaussian cross-scale couplings. We find that low-order couplings, particularly between large and intermediate scales, are highly sensitive to the FDM particle mass and remain robust under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise.

We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime.

Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit.\n  Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices."}

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\\,{\\rm{M}}_\\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\\sim 5\\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process.

We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060. We also used multiwavelength data from TGSS (radio), 2MASS (IR), and NED (optical) to investigate the non-thermal emission, 2D galaxy distribution, and its redshift evolution, respectively. The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$.

The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection."}

The construction of the state relies on the insertion of a heavy matter operator, which supports the baby universe, together with a first-order thermal phase transition between a black hole phase and an empty Anti de Sitter (AdS) phase. For the transition, we employ a version of the Maldacena-Qi phase transition of two coupled SYK systems.

Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy.

However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages."}

In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $Λ$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics."}

Each simulation in the suite has a unique set of initial conditions and combination of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. The suite is designed to quantify theoretical uncertainties from halo-to-halo variance, as well as stellar and black hole feedback. We develop a novel weighting scheme that prioritizes regions of the input parameter space, yielding galaxies consistent with the observed present-day stellar mass--halo mass relation. The resulting galaxy population exhibits a wide diversity in structural properties that encompasses those of the actual Milky Way, providing a powerful statistical sample for galactic archaeology. To demonstrate the suite's scientific utility, we investigate the connection between a galaxy's merger history, focusing on Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus~(GSE) analogs, and its present-day properties. We find that galaxies with a GSE analog have lower star formation rates, more compact disks, and more spherical stellar halos. Crucially, significant halo-to-halo scatter remains, demonstrating that matching more than the most significant events in the Milky Way's past is necessary to recover its present-day properties. Our results highlight the necessity for large statistical samples to disentangle the stochastic nature of galaxy formation and robustly model the Milky Way's unique history."}

The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations."}

In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies."}

We argue that $\\ln Z$ develops a simple pole in $(1-ω_i)$ for each $ω_i$ that is scaled to unity. The residue of this product of poles is a theory dependent (so non-universal) function of $β$ and the fixed angular velocities. The inverse Laplace transformation of this partition function constrains the functional form of the field theory entropy as a function of charges in a limit in which angular momenta and the twist are scaled as follows. While $n$ special angular momenta $J_1\\ldots J_n$ are scaled to infinity, the twist and the other angular momenta - collectively denoted $x_i$ - are also taken to infinity but at the slower rate that ensures that the scaled charges $x_i/(J_1 J_2 \\ldots J_n)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}$ are held fixed. In this limit, we demonstrate that the scaled entropy $S/(J_1 J_2 \\ldots J_n)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}$ depends only on the $\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor-n+1$ scaled charges defined above (the precise form of this dependence is non-universal).

Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \\sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds.

This paper aims to understand the detailed physical processes behind such behaviors and investigate how such an episodic star-forming scenario can explain the scatter in star-formation rate (SFR) of star-forming main-sequence galaxies. This is achieved through tracing back in time the history of z=0 star-forming central galaxies in the TNG100 simulation over the past 7-8 Gyrs. As the first paper in this series, we provide an overview of the episodic star formation history. We find that two branches of star formation typically develop during each episode: while one branch happens in heavily metal-enriched gas in the centers of galaxies, a secondary branch starts in lower-metallicity regions at galaxy outskirts where fresh gas first arrives, and gradually progresses to inner regions of galaxies. Additionally, the temporal variation in the SFR at galaxy outskirts is more significant than that at centers. As a consequence, the metallicities in both gas and young stars exhibit remarkably different distributions between SFR peaks and valleys. The resulting temporal SFR fluctuation within individual galaxies has an average of ~ 0.2 dex, while the intrinsic differentiation between (the historical mean of) galaxies is ~ 0.15 dex. These two together can well account for the scatter in SFR of ~ 0.25 dex as observed for z=0 star-forming main-sequence galaxies."}

Our stability results are derived from a careful analysis of the $d$-dimensional Lichnerowicz equation with mass-squared $m^2$ and of semiclassical equations involving the dimensionless parameter $γ_d$. For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $γ_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $γ_4$ exceeds its critical value. In contrast, in $d=5$, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes remain stable for almost all values of the parameter $γ_5$, except for a regime in which higher-curvature corrections become comparable to the Einstein tensor."}

The current NO$ν$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$δ_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $δ_{\\rm CP} \\in [0,180^\\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $δ_{\\rm CP} \\in [180^\\circ,360^\\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $δ_{\\rm CP}\\simeq 270^\\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2σ$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$δ_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$ν$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $δ_{\\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$ν$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|Δ_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\\sin^2θ_{23}$ and $δ_{\\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$ν$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data."}

In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in on-going galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical `slingshot' mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect co-evolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (~2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ~10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries."}

WL induces stringent requirements on the shape and stability of the VIS instrument system point spread function (PSF). The PSF is affected by error contributions from the telescope, the focal plane and image motion, and is controlled by a global error budget with error allocations to each contributor. Aims. During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (<300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope."}

In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning.

The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes."}

A striking feature of ParT is its sparse, nearly binary, attention structure, raising questions about the origin of this behavior and whether it encodes physically meaningful correlations. In this work, we investigate the source of ParT's sparse attention by comparing models trained on multiple benchmark datasets and examine the relative contributions of the attention term and the physics-inspired interaction matrix before softmax. We find that binary sparsity arises primarily from the attention mechanism itself, with the interaction matrix playing a secondary role. Moreove, we show that ParT is able to identify key jet substructure elements, such as leptons in semileptonic top decays, even without explicit particle identification inputs. These results provide new insight into the interpretability of transformer-based jet taggers and clarify the conditions under which sparse attention patterns emerge in ParT."}

In this work, we test this hypothesis using a suite of turbulent simulations with Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}=4$ and 8, and three turbulent forcing wavenumbers ($k_{\\rm for}=2,4$ and 8). Dense cores are identified through dendrogram analysis of column density maps, and their separations are compared to the sonic scale measured from velocity structure functions. We find no statistical correlation between the core separation and the sonic scale nor with the driving scale. Instead, for each run, the core separation spans the entire range of values between these two scales. Our results indicate that fragmentation in turbulence-dominated clouds is not governed by an intrinsic scale in the turbulent cascade. This finding calls into question the use of the sonic scale as a predictive quantity in star formation theories and cautions against interpreting observational core spacings as evidence for universal turbulent fragmentation physics."}

The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware."}

Furthermore, we identify new fermionic (second-class) constraints that are necessary to recover the Dirac-fermion theory by relating the momenta to the configuration variables on dynamical solutions; this fermionic phase-space reduction is accomplished by use of corresponding Dirac brackets. The theory remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surfaces with ten additional degrees of freedom - six of which are gravitational and the remaining four are fermionic.

In this case, in addition to the standard invariant tensor $δ^{ij}$, there exists another invariant tensor $ε^{ij}$, which enables the construction of genuinely new realizations beyond the conventional one. We show that these new realizations arise from a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$--grading of the mode index $n$ of the Virasoro generators $L_n$ and the space of such realizations corresponds to points of a possibly singular algebraic variety. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ cases, the space of all such constructions is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, while for $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ it forms a non-compact real four-dimensional manifold.

Using A stars to map extinction, we trace the main run of dust obscuration, situated at mainly negative Galactic latitudes. Like the dust, OB and emission line stars are more frequent below the Galactic equator: at heliocentric distances of up to ~7 kpc, these stars' distribution fit in with the known warping of the Galactic plane. An overdensity of B stars, several degrees across and potentially in the Outer Arm, is found around (l,b) = (212.0, -0.6)."}

To address these applications, we present Kratos-polrad, a novel GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code built upon the heterogeneous computing framework of Kratos, designed for self-consistent and efficient polarization calculations. It utlizes comprehensive treatment of Stokes parameters throughout photon propagation, featuring transforms the grain-lab frame transforms using quaternion algebra and consistent non-linear polarization extinction in cells, which are useful in modeling radiative transfer processes with scatterings by aligned dust grains. The code implements two-step polarimetry imaging that decouples Monte Carlo sampling of scattering physics from imaging geometry, enabling efficient synthesis maximizing the utilization of photon packets. Extensive validation against analytical solutions and established codes demonstrates accurate treatment of diverse polarization phenomena, including self-scattering polarization, dichroic extinction in aligned dust grains, and complex polarization patterns in twisted magnetic field configurations. By leveraging massive GPU parallelism, optimized memory access patterns, and analytical approaches for optically thick cells, Kratos-polrad achieves performance improvements of $\\sim 10^{2}$ times compared to CPU-based methods, enabling previously prohibitive studies in polarimetric astrophysics."}

We find an integer number of string configurations on the worldsheet, which we call line defects, that run from one boundary of the cylinder to the other. We insert two sources (conical defects) at each boundary and fix the two ends of the line defect by Dirichlet boundary conditions to a point $r_c$ in target space. In target space, a line defect appears as an Susskind\\&Uglum-type open string ending on $r_c$. We compute the semiclassical contribution to the off-shell cylinder amplitude by saddle point approximation. The amplitude has an interesting infrared (IR) divergence structure that depends on the given range of the cone angle. We then compute the entropy by varying the cone angle. In a particular renormalization scheme that relates the ultraviolet (UV) and to the infrared (IR) limits of the modulus integral, we find the entropy to be free of IR divergences but linearly dependent on the radial cutoff. We argue that our calculation provides a well-defined state on a constant Euclidean-time slice directly from the string worldsheet. We also study the 2D flat cone NLSM without discretization. We compute the entropy from the off-shell stationary action and show it is finite in each winding sector $W$ with a maximum at $r_c=\\sqrt{α'}/|W|$.

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\\,{\\rm{M}}_\\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\\sim 5\\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process.

Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics.

We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments.

We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176.

Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \\sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $ν$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector."}

This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin."}

We tune this model to LHC data and contrast it with several alternatives. We comment specifically on the challenge of simultaneously describing the strangeness data and the non-strange p/pi ratio, and introduce a mechanism which may act to suppress the latter. Many of the salient particle-production ratios can be qualitatively described by this model, although the XiC/D ratio and the shape of pT spectra remain challenging to account for."}

We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars.

The techniques presented here reflect the state of the art in real-time RFI mitigation at the time of publication and include methods such as filtering, digital processing, and optimal scheduling. The proposed catalogue also explores new ideas like satellite avoidance through scheduling, the use of intelligent surfaces to block interference, and advanced computer algorithms to clean up data. The chapter also highlights the need for strong cooperation between astronomers and spectrum regulators to protect radio frequencies for future discoveries.

We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $η$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $η$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon."}

Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution."}

By showing how the requirement of local U(1) invariance leads naturally to the electromagnetic interaction, we illustrate the essential logic behind gauge theories and highlight the conceptual structure that underlies the Standard Model Lagrangian."}

These experiments are tailored to mimic what is expected to be the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, which occurred circa 10 Gyr ago in the Milky Way (MW). We find that either an early clumpy phase or a retrograde merger significantly reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the disk, giving rise to a chemical bimodality qualitatively similar to the MW's. The decrease of the SFR as the cause of the chemical bimodality is consistent with previous idealized and cosmological simulations. On the other hand, a prograde radial merger does not significantly modify the SFR of the disk, resulting in no clear chemical bimodality. We further show that stars originating from the inner regions ($R_{form}<4$ kpc) do not create the disk's chemical bimodality, although they can enhance it. Finally, only the models with an early clumpy phase can produce a significant fraction of old, age $>11$ Gyr, $α-$poor stars with disk-like orbits, similar to what has been recently observed in the MW. Our results strengthen the case of clumpy disky galaxies observed at redshift $z\\approx 1-2$ as likely progenitors of our Galaxy."}

Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start."}

The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region.

By computing the circular reduction of the one-loop Chern-Simons term and pure-gravity couplings in type IIA theory and applying the T-duality transformation to the resulting couplings, we derive their counterparts in the type IIB effective action. We demonstrate that the resulting nine-dimensional type IIB couplings are invariant under S-duality without requiring contributions from the tree-level effective action or non-perturbative effects. This result is non-trivial: while S-duality forbids one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in ten-dimensional type IIB theory, we show that the one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in nine dimensions, derived from the T-duality of type IIA, are S-duality invariant.

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10--15 pc, with member separations of 1--3.3 pc. Around 65\\% are tightly clustered ($<$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores -- predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs -- reveals a median core separation of $\\sim$0.03 pc. The protostellar spacing ($\\sim$0.7 pc) significantly exceeds the thermal Jeans length ($\\sim$0.08 pc for temperature $\\sim$18 K and density $\\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$), whereas the core spacing is smaller than the Jeans length, suggesting that thermal fragmentation may influence core formation but alone cannot explain the larger-scale protostellar distribution. All these findings together support a picture in which fragments of clouds/filaments form clumps hosting compact HFSs that facilitate efficient and clustered star formation, often yielding massive stars."}

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations."}

A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $κ$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory."}

Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\\rm H}α$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs."}

This leads to modified displacement, spin, and center of mass memory (CM) expressions, where the gravitational contributions retain their General Relativity (GR) form and the vector field enters only through well defined flux terms. We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables. The BMS transformations act kinematically as in GR. Tensor vacua remain supertranslation degenerate, whereas the vector vacuum, defined by the vanishing vector field, is nondegenerate.

When combined with Gaia positional measurements, this data set enables the investigation of the bulk motion and the internal kinematics of these poorly studied clusters to an unprecedented level of detail. Focusing on the case of NGC 6749, we here showcase how the combined Gaia HST proper motions have a quality sufficient to accurately assess the cluster stellar membership, determine its absolute proper motion with a precision superior to Gaia, and to investigate its kinematic profile for the first time. Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey."}

We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations.

Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV.

Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I.

We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}.

As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section."}

The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts.

In this article, we analyze the process by employing the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. Conventional scale setting leads to theoretical predictions affected by errors dominated by renormalization scale uncertainty. The PMC provides a systematic method to eliminate this renormalization scale uncertainty by resumming non-conformal $β$ contributions into the QCD running coupling via renormalization group equation (RGE). We obtain a PMC scale result of $Q_\\star = 3.29\\ \\text{GeV}$, which reflects the low virtuality of the underlying QCD dynamics for the $H \\to J/ψ+ γ$ process. In fact, this is an order of magnitude smaller than the guessed scale using the conventional method, i.e., $μ_r = m_H/2$. By removing non-conformal $\\{β_i\\}$-terms from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) series, the PMC eliminates renormalization scale uncertainty. Comparing results, we find that the PMC NLO QCD correction term is significantly enhanced, while the PMC NNLO QCD correction is suppressed.

The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously."}

Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory.

The total yield of created particles increases monotonically with the increase of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent in the high-frequency fields with small chirp and low-frequency fields with any chirp.

Furthermore, based on rest-frame 1 $μ$m morphologies, we have derived spatially resolved stellar mass and SFR surface density ($Σ_*$ and $Σ_{\\rm SFR}$) profiles for 46,313 galaxies with reliable structural measurements at $0<z<4$ and $\\log(M_\\ast /M_{\\odot})>8$, and provide the corresponding catalogue. For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z>2.5$), the median radial profile of $Σ_{\\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $Σ_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z>2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z<2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts."}

Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes."}

The current NO$ν$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$δ_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $δ_{\\rm CP} \\in [0,180^\\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $δ_{\\rm CP} \\in [180^\\circ,360^\\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $δ_{\\rm CP}\\simeq 270^\\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2σ$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$δ_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$ν$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $δ_{\\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$ν$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|Δ_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\\sin^2θ_{23}$ and $δ_{\\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$ν$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision.

While single-source models fail at higher energies and independent multi-source approaches do not reproduce the central dip observed at LHC energies, a unified description across the full RHIC-LHC energy range remains elusive. These distributions from Au+Au collisions at RHIC ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6--200 GeV) and Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76--5.36 TeV) are analyzed using a novel parametrization based on coupled Gaussian sources where the interaction strength is quantified by parameter $λ$. This coupled two-source model captures the interaction between forward and backward sources through the medium formed in the collision. Remarkably, $λ$ exhibits empirical scaling behavior resembling $1/μ_B$, suggesting sensitivity to baryon stopping and the strongly-interacting medium. All fitting parameters follow systematic energy trends, with the peak-to-peak distance and chemical freeze-out temperature exhibiting identical exponential saturation patterns, indicating that geometric expansion and thermal evolution share a common underlying dynamics governed by QCD phase structure. Furthermore, the approach naturally preserves limiting fragmentation behavior across all energies, in contrast to independent source models that suggest its violation at LHC energies. Although the theoretical basis requires further investigation, these empirical correlations successfully unify charged particle production across nearly two orders of magnitude in collision energy, revealing fundamental connections to underlying collision dynamics."}

These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties."}

We model the observations using a newly developed PDR wrapper that takes into account the geometry of this region. PDR modeling of the molecular and atomic lines studied here provides strong constraints on the thermal pressure, but not on the UV illumination. Maximum model line intensities %typically agree to within ~40\\% with the observations. and spatial profiles are well reproduced, except for CO isotopologues, where the increase on the illuminated side of the PDR is steeper than observed.

With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected H$α$ star formation rate of SFR$_{Hα} = 0.024 \\pm 0.001$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we find in the most \"star-forming\" clumps indications of lower ionization (log$_{10}$U $\\sim -3.2$), lower nebular metallicities (12+log$_{10}$O/H $\\lesssim$ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy.

Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $Σ$$Ξ$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $Ξ$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $Ξ(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\\bar{3}) + (\\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum."}

Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8σ$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons.

The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware."}

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum.

Using the low-energy effective field theory extended with light right-handed neutrinos and matching to chiral perturbation theory, we systematically analyze these contributions, deriving constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients from neutrino mass bounds, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and light pseudoscalar meson invisible decays.

We demonstrate how detection of a relatively heavy QCD axion at small $h^{1,1}$, e.g. by ADMX, provides detailed information about CY geometry and topology. Finally, we compute a full forward model incorporating likelihoods from the cosmic microwave background and Lyman-alpha forest and find the maximum posterior probability region on the moduli space of a given CY favoured by a resolution of the tension in these data by an ultralight axion composing $\\mathcal{O}(1\\%)$ of the dark matter. This demonstration serves as a blueprint for future statistical analyses within string phenomenology."}

The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields."}

Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS."}

For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $γ_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $γ_4$ exceeds its critical value.

In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning.

In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $Λ$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics."}

We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs.

We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space."}

A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $κ$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory."}
