The energy density, pressure\nand entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to\nthe Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon\nplasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable\nfield-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum\nthe confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The\nmesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the\nconfining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition\nat $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the\nexistence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and\nantiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color\nsinglet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral\nlimit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the\noverlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The\nBethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of\nthe color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and\nin the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the\nquark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in\nvacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided\nby the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems."}

These simulation studies indicate\nthat while steady disk galaxies can be well-modeled as \"equilibrium disks\"\nembedded in a distinct, hot CGM, bursty galaxies are much more dynamic and\ntheir star formation occurs in a dispersion-dominated medium that extends to\nhalo scales, with no clear boundary between the ISM and the CGM. We develop an\nanalytic framework to model star formation in bursty galaxies that are not\nadequately modeled as equilibrium disks. The framework approximates the gas in\nlow-mass halos as a continuous, supersonically turbulent medium with large\ndensity fluctuations. Star formation occurs locally in the high-density tail of\na roughly lognormal density distribution. This is analogous to turbulent models\nof star formation in molecular clouds, but here applied on inner CGM scales. By\ncomparing with galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project, we show that\nthis framework can be used to understand star formation efficiencies and radial\nprofiles in halos. The turbulent framework shows explicitly how the\ninstantaneous galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency can be relatively low\neven if the local efficiency in dense gas approaches unity."}

Simulating the formation and early evolution of stellar clusters with Phantom N-Body", "comment": null, "summary": "Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is\nnumerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and\ntheir surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims.\nThis paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early\nstellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework\nwhich is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling\nstatistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics\ncommunity, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been\nadded to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded\ncluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star\nformation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is\nconsistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region\nexpansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run\ntestcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from\nthe cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their\nfunction by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel\nimplementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that\nmassive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics\nof the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and\nthe strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the\ncloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming\nlow-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical\nstudies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient\nsimulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the\nstatistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of\nembedded star clusters."}

Utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and\ndifferent methods ($\\Lambda$CDM model, Cosmography, and Gaussian process\nmethod), we investigated the impact of methodology and dataset on $z_{ztr}$\nconstraints, and find that the choice of method has a greater impact on\n$z_{tr}$ than the observations themselves. Through a statistical analysis of\nthe $z_{ztr}$ constraints from 2004 to 2024, we find that total $z_{tr}$\nconstraints (2004$-$2024) can be well described by a Gaussian function with the\nmean value 0.65 and the standard deviation 0.16; that is, $\\bar{z}_{tr}$(all) =\n0.65 $\\pm$ 0.16.

Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is\nnumerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and\ntheir surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims.\nThis paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early\nstellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework\nwhich is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling\nstatistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics\ncommunity, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been\nadded to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded\ncluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star\nformation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is\nconsistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region\nexpansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run\ntestcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from\nthe cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their\nfunction by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel\nimplementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that\nmassive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics\nof the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and\nthe strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the\ncloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming\nlow-mass stars.

All but one galaxy are in the\nredshift range $1.9 \\leq z \\leq 2$, the outlier being at $z = 3.1$. Our sample\ncovers a range of $8.0 <$ \\logM $< 9.5$ in stellar mass, $0.2 <$\n$\\log{\\rm{(SFR}}$/\\Msunpyr) $< 1.1$ in star-formation rate (SFR) and $7.8 <$\n\\logOH $< 9.0$ in global metallicity.

We present the mass-metallicity gradient\nrelation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps\nhinting at the fact that the high-$z$ galaxies have not yet started their\naccretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially\nresolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of\nmetal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale\nincreases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass\ngalaxies."}

The energy density, pressure\nand entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to\nthe Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon\nplasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable\nfield-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum\nthe confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The\nmesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the\nconfining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition\nat $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the\nexistence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and\nantiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color\nsinglet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral\nlimit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the\noverlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The\nBethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of\nthe color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and\nin the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the\nquark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in\nvacuum.

Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in\nclassical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant,\nnon-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations\nof lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge\ntheories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated\ntemperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator\naccurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range\nof lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a\ngeneral-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential\napplications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time\nmonitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms."}
