We propose a new strategy using\nmulti-cavity arrays to distinguish signal from background noise by exploiting\nspatial correlations in the axion-induced electric fields. We compute the\ntwo-point correlation function for electric fields in spatially separated\ncavities sourced by an isotropic C$a$B.

Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are\neither integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of\ntranslationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited\nenergies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or\nemergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these\ninvestigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are\nlattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also\ngenerically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter.\nUsing a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of\nathermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is\nsubjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes\nin the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an\ninterplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes\nexotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities.\nThis causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical\narguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in\nthe linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation.

We argue that cold dark\nmatter (CDM) isocurvature fluctuations with blue-tilted spectrum are not only\nconsistent with current cosmological data, but also can loosen the bound on the\nmasses of warm dark matter (WDM), which suppresses small-scale power. In pure\nthermal WDM models with the adiabatic initial condition, a combination of the\ndata from Lyman-$\\alpha$, gravitational lensing, and Milky Way satellites gives\na lower bound on the WDM mass as $6~{\\rm keV}$ at $95\\%$ C.L. while mixed\nWDM+CDM models loosen these bounds to $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim1$ keV for a\nwarm-fraction $f_{\\rm WDM}\\lesssim0.14$ and $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim600$ eV for $f_{\\rm\nWDM}\\lesssim0.08$. On the other hand, as we demonstrate, WDM scenarios with a\nblue-tilted CDM isocurvature power spectrum, even with only $1\\%$ CDM\ncontribution ($f_{\\rm WDM}\\sim0.99$), can allow WDM masses as low as $600$ eV.\nWe further assess the implications of this ``warm + cold-isocurvature''\nextension for the small-scale structure by performing $N$-body simulations,\nparticularly focusing on nonlinear matter power spectrum and halo mass\nfunction."}

We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such\nsource, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across\nnearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\\sim$ pc to $\\sim100$ kpc\n(projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\\sim\n610$ pc ($\\sim 7.9 \\times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition\nto a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates\nfrom the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles\nthose in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how\nthe jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic\ncollimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the\nsphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\\sim7.3\\times10^{5} R_{S}$),\nand no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to\nprovide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet\nconfinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal\ncomponents, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These\nmechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas.\nOur results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under\nrare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet\nformation beyond traditional models."}

This work presents a novel computational\nimaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive\noptics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use\nthe AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely\ncontrolled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images\nthat exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then\nbe jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image.

To achieve this, we incorporate\nend-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the\nupsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal\nstatistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our\nexperimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,\ndemonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO\nsuper-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no\nhardware modifications.

We evaluate the fluctuation\nmoments for the number of particles and the correlated fluctuations for number\nand energy of particles, clustering under their mutual gravitation. The\ncorrelated fluctuations $<\\Delta N\\Delta U>$ show that the value of $<\\Delta\nN>$ can be both positive as well as negative, because it is the difference\nbetween $N$ and the mean value of $N$. A negative $<\\Delta N>$ corresponds to\nregions of under density and positive $<\\Delta N>$ corresponds to regions of\nover density, as described by the clustering parameter $b$. The present work is\nconcerned in the region $b\\ge 0$, at which gravitational interaction has\nalready started causing the galaxies to cluster. Thus for this work the value\nof $<\\Delta N>$ is positive. Similarly, the energy fluctuations $<\\Delta U>$\ncan also be both positive and negative. For large correlations, the overdense\nregions typically have negative total energy and underdense regions have\nusually positive total energy.

The evaluation has been extended to multicomponent systems, having\na variety of masses.

With this large sample, we\nidentify a clear association between C$_2$H emission and the protostellar\noutflow cavity walls, and a consistent spatial anti-correlation between C$_2$H\nand SO emission. Together, these trends confirm that C$_2$H is tracing\nphotochemically active, O-poor gas in these younger sources. We fitted the\nC$_2$H spectra with a simple LTE model to yield column density maps, and find\nvalues ranging from 10$^{14}$ -- 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in these sources.

We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to\npredict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification\nprovided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters\nunmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy\nsimilar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic\nabundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because\nof their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which\nwould host fewer stars.

In this work, we study this induced GW signal within the context of\n$f(R)$ gravity theories investigating the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the\nbehaviour of scalar perturbations during the PBH-driven eMD era as well as on\nthe source of the second-order induced tensor modes. In particular, we focus on\ntwo very minimal $f(R)$ models, that is $R^2$ and $R^{1+\\epsilon}$, with\n$\\epsilon\\ll 1$, gravity theories as illustrative examples, finding at the end\nthat $R^2$ gravity presents very small deviations from general relativity (GR)\nat the level of both the scalar and tensor perturbations. However,\n$R^{1+\\epsilon}$ gravity features a different behaviour, exhibiting in\nparticular an exponential growth of scalar perturbations during a\nmatter-dominated era. This unique feature leads ultimately to an enhanced\ninduced GW signal even for very small initial PBH abundances, being\ncharacterized by a linear frequency scaling on large infrared scales away from\nthe peak frequency, i.e. $\\Omega_\\mathrm{GW}(k)\\propto f$ for $f\\ll\nf_\\mathrm{peak}$, and a spiky behaviour close to the non-linear cut-off scale\nbelow which perturbation theory breaks down.

The calculations\nshow that $\\beta$ and $\\lambda$ strongly influence velocity distributions,\nshifting peaks, creating double-peak structures, or enhancing dark matter\ndominance in the bulge or disk. To assess observational implications, we\nperform Bayesian analyses using data from the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda\n(M31), which offer complementary characteristics: MW provides precise velocity\nprofiles across multiple scales, while M31 includes broader morphological\nconstraints. We examine four scenarios: Yukawa gravity without dark matter,\ndark matter with non-trivial coupling, fully modified gravity, and standard\nNewtonian gravity. Results show that MW models with $\\lambda < 1$ kpc yield\nhigh Bayes factors but risk overfitting, as dark matter mimics baryonic\nkinematics, while M31's photometric priors from conjugate observations mitigate\nthis, yielding robust parameter estimates. However, in M31, Bayes factors favor\nNewtonian gravity, suggesting that current data lack the precision to resolve\nmore complex models. This finding highlights two key needs: (i) realistic,\nphysically or empirically informed priors to avoid biased constraints, and (ii)\nhigh-precision data with independent photometry to guard against overfitting.\nOur framework offers a scalable approach for testing gravity with large\ngalactic rotation curve datasets."}

We study the\nperturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. %The analysis is\nmore involved now, because of the %couplings of the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic modes %to both the dilaton and axion fields. The systems of\nequations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but\nthey can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a\n1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that\ndetermines the coupling of the axion to the $\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\,\nF_{\\mu\\nu}\\, F_{\\rho\\sigma}$ term.

In this one case we find that the\nperturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable\ntransformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the\nperturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This\ntransformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models.\nThe existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations\nappears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity\nsupporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are\nnon-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of\nthe static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other\nvalues of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the\nmodes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the\nhorizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being\nperturbative mode instabilities in such a case."}
