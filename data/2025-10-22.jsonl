The underlying elementary $N\\pi$ amplitudes are described by a\nhybrid effective model, combining the non-resonant background from chiral\nperturbation theory with resonant contributions via Breit-Wigner\nparameterizations. These amplitudes are used to calculate the vacuum and\nthermally-averaged cross-sections for deuteron dissociation and production,\nnamely, $d + \\pi \\rightarrow N + N' + \\pi$ and the corresponding inverse\nreaction. We then use these cross sections in a rate equation to estimate the\ntime evolution of the deuteron multiplicity. For the initial conditions we\nconsider two models: the statistical hadronization model and the coalescence\nmodel, where the deuteron is treated as a hadronic molecule. Our findings\nsuggest that the final deuteron yield does not retain a memory of its initial\nproduction mechanism."}

For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate\nthat present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly\nshaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that\ncan be tested with future observational measurements."}

Two well-studied examples are $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity\nand Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same\nvacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter\nsuffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the\nstrong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to\ngenuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting\nframework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a\ngravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with\nnontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB\ngravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile\nsetting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic\ncorrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\\mathcal{R})$\nterms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting\nsolutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes\nwith certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a\nnontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the\nblack-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity\nstructure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of\npure EdGB gravity.

One of the results we obtain is\nthat it showcases the switchback effect, when the appropriate ``triple-scaling\nlimit'' is taken, under which the model becomes dual to semiclassical JT\ngravity. We build on previous work, where it was shown that, in the continuum\nlimit, Krylov complexity is defined as the sum of expectations value of right\nand left chord number operators. Here we argue that this property signals the\nemergence of the geometric nature of this notion of K-complexity. We show that\nin the regime where DSSYK is dual to semi-classical gravity, the light matter\nchord corresponds to a shockwave insertion in JT gravity. We identify the\ngeodesic-length dual of the operator complexity and extend the relevant\nholographic dictionary to describe the details of the matter insertions.\nAdditionally, we define a class of two-sided perturbations of the Lanczos\nalgorithm that allows to analyze the switchback effect. In the appropriate\nsemi-classical limit, this perturbed operator complexity is dual to an ERB\nlength in JT gravity with corresponding shockwave insertions. We thus establish\nthat K-complexity exhibits the expected switchback effect and universal\nlate-time linear growth, consistent with previous findings regarding its\ngeometric nature in the holographic bulk-boundary map."}

We investigate the individual kinematics by computing\nrotation curves and dynamical masses for each galaxy in the sample. The\naccuracy of our kinematic results is confirmed through comparisons with HI data\nand by applying the B- and K-band Tully-Fisher relationships. Among the\ngalaxies studied, we observed a rotational lag along the $z$-axis in half of\nthe total sample (7 out of 14 cases), with an average lag ($\\Delta V/\\Delta\nz=32.0\\pm10.6\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,pc^{-1}}$) consistent with previous research\nfindings.

The two\ndominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as\nboth can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of\na star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated\nthe visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY,\nand MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the\ninterferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability.\nWe explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges\nin distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the\nsource of the observed excess.

Contrary to the common\ninterpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a\ncompanion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data,\nas indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions\ncan still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by\nreevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A.

To isolate the impact\nof hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their\nremnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters.\nIn uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit\nbackflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes\nare shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler;\nwhile PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In\nstratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer\nand thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT\njets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long\nfilamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with\nvarying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have\na similar impact on the ambient medium.

In the strong-field regime, we compute the Lyapunov\nexponent $\\lambda$ associated with the photon sphere and establish its exact\nrelations with the critical impact parameter $\\mathcal{B}_u$ and the angular\nsize of the shadow $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, given by $\\mathcal{B}_u =\n1/|\\lambda|$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(r_{0}|\\lambda|)$. These\ncorrespondences reveal that the dynamical instability of null circular orbits\ngoverns the optical appearance of the black hole. Our results show that\nincreasing $A$ reduces the instability of photon trajectories and enlarges the\nangular size of the shadow, indicating that the regularization scale leaves a\ndistinct observational imprint on the geometry of regular black holes. In\naddition, constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*\nand Sgr A* further restrict the allowed range of the scalar charge, reinforcing\nthe consistency of the model with current astrophysical observations."}

For the total inclusive\ncross section, we provide matched predictions of the massless five-flavour\nscheme (5FS) and the massive four-flavour scheme (4FS) at the fixed-order\nlevel. We further present recently obtained simulations matched with parton\nshowers in both flavour schemes within the SM, and also discuss them in the\ncontext of potential BSM scenarios. In the massless scheme, we compare\ndifferent NNLO+PS predictions obtained through the MiNNLOPS and GENEVA\ngenerators. In addition, the role of 4FS predictions is studied as a background\nto $HH$ searches, considering both the top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa\ncontributions to $b\\bar bH$ production. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of\nthe Higgs transverse momentum spectrum to light-quark Yukawa couplings in the\ndiphoton decay channel based on MiNNLOPS simulations."}

Two well-studied examples are $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity\nand Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same\nvacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter\nsuffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the\nstrong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to\ngenuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting\nframework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a\ngravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with\nnontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB\ngravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile\nsetting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic\ncorrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\\mathcal{R})$\nterms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting\nsolutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes\nwith certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a\nnontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the\nblack-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity\nstructure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of\npure EdGB gravity. This suggests that, at the nonperturbative level, the\ntheory's ill-posedness cannot be resolved by adding individual higher-order\nterms. This conjecture could be tested by studying the nonlinear dynamics,\nwhich remains governed by second-order field equations."}

While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas\nfraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we\nnote that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has\nnot been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive\nblack holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than\npreviously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate\nthat present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly\nshaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that\ncan be tested with future observational measurements."}

We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo\ndetectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on\n$\\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\\beta \\sim 2.2$ can be\ndetected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\\beta \\sim 1$. Importantly, we\nfind that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally\naffected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model.\nThis is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or\nshallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations\nare added to the lens model.

In this work, we present a new framework for analyzing\nthe thermal dust signal using polarized microwave data. We introduce residual\nmaps, represented as complex quantities, that capture deviations of the local\npolarized SED from the mean complex SED averaged over the sky mask. We make\nsimple predictions that relate the values of the statistical correlation and\ncovariances between the residual maps to the physical properties of the\nemitting aligned grains. The validation or falsification of these predictions\nprovide valuable information on the nature of the dust signal.

The spectral dependence of the covariances\nbetween residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a\ndust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index\nvariations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck\nofficial release.

We compare systematically observational bounds\nwith theoretical predictions for both E-model ($\\alpha$-Starobinsky) and\nT-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with\n$\\alpha \\lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($\\alpha = 1$)\npredicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 -\n10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL\nregion determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95%\nconfidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating\ntemperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility.\nT-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension\nwith Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $\\alpha \\lesssim 11$ in\nthese models.

Unlike flat space, charged de Sitter black holes do not\nevolve towards extremality, but rather towards a thermal equilibrium with the\ncosmological horizon. In the low-temperature regime, the near-horizon physics\ncan be effectively captured by a one-dimensional Schwarzian theory. This is\ncoupled to the far-horizon de Sitter quantum field theory. Incorporating the\nthermal nature of the cosmological horizon, we compute the quantum energy\ntransfer through uncharged massless scalar particles.

The replica sector yields a\nradiatively generated gluon screening mass, while the RGZ parameters are fixed\nby the horizon and condensate gap equations; we also give infrared matching\nconditions that link both descriptions at small momentum. We present a compact\nBRST-superspace rewriting of the RGZ block and a simple hybrid superspace that\nhosts the ST replicas and RGZ side by side; these add no dynamics and organize\nthe Ward-identity analysis.

These\nobservations impose stringent limits on the scalar charge, confirming that $A$\nmust remain extremely small in the weak-field regime to ensure full consistency\nwith general relativity. In the strong-field regime, we compute the Lyapunov\nexponent $\\lambda$ associated with the photon sphere and establish its exact\nrelations with the critical impact parameter $\\mathcal{B}_u$ and the angular\nsize of the shadow $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, given by $\\mathcal{B}_u =\n1/|\\lambda|$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(r_{0}|\\lambda|)$.

This dual mechanism is novel and\nleads to a propagating fractonic degree of freedom described by a massive\nKlein-Gordon equation. The theory propagates two degrees of freedom -- one\nmassive, one massless -- whose number is preserved in the massless limit, in\nanalogy with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons mechanism of Deser-Jackiw-Templeton.
