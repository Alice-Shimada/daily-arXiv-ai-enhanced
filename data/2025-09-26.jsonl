This system allows the\nspacecraft to precisely match Io's orbital velocity, similar to a surfer riding\na wave. By optimizing tether current and orientation, UNAGI transitions from an\nouter Jovian insertion orbit to an orbit around Io, achieving a controlled\nlanding for on-surface science operations. The landing is strategically timed,\nleveraging the gravitational influence of Jupiter and its moons to decelerate\ndescent and mitigate impact forces.\n  UNAGI leverages technologies from missions like Juno, JUICE, and Europa\nClipper to ensure reliable operation in the challenging Jovian environment. The\nmission follows a phased approach, including cruise, orbital insertion, tether\ndeployment, Jovian orbital operations, and final descent, with extensive risk\nmitigation through simulations and experimental validation.

Moreover, it accommodates arbitrary boundary\nconditions for bulk fields, moving beyond the standard Dirichlet prescription.\nAs part of this development, we construct a one-parameter family of\nrenormalized boundary conditions that, unlike conventional choices in the\nliterature, lead to a finite on-shell action. We also explore intriguing\nconsequences of the framework, including the emergence of induced gravity and\nthe flow of boundary conditions under holographic renormalization."}

The scalaron interacts with the\nStandard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the\nscalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the\nlack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and\nobservational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM\ncandidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs,\ndespite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced\ntrilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the\n$R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the\nearly universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of\nthe scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear\ninteraction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs\nnon-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron\ndensity through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we\nfind that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between\n$1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC\nconstraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises\nfrom INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron\ndecays to two photons."}

A clean dwarf\ngalaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess\nsurface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\\log\n\\rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\\odot$ and $\\log \\rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\\odot$), with\nsignal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise\ndrops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying\nindividual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber\nincompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against\nvariations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing\ncalibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with\nstellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation\nand find a satellite fraction of $\\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous\nphotometric studies but $1.5\\sigma$ lower than $\\Lambda$CDM predictions. We\nfind that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can\nchange the inferred $f_{\\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need\nfor accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our\nresults open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low\nmasses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations\nand weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models\nand $\\Lambda$CDM predictions."}

Comparative\nanalyses between the known and newly identified subsamples revealed that new\nX-ray clusters exhibit systematically higher redshifts, lower masses, and\nsmaller X-ray-to-optical mass ratios, but show no systematic differences in\ndynamical properties. The newly identified X-ray clusters are a valuable\naddition to previous X-ray samples and are important for future statistical\nstudies."}

Deuterated molecular\nions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is\nenhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of\northo-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um\ncontinuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the\npreviously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central\northo-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\\sigma$ contrast and an inferred\ndiameter $\\lesssim$600au, together with a peak\n$x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred\nprofiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a\ndeuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+\ndepletion is only marginally matched within the $2\\sigma$ upper limit, likely\nsuggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we\ninfer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that\nthe substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather\nthan slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that\northo-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly\nthermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few\nfree-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions\nfor both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores."}

While the introduction of a fundamental length scale\nindeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show\nthat the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds\ngenerically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic\nand quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true\nremnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating\nobjects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a\ncosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting\nradiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the\ncosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds.

The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often\ninvoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their\nconflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability\nof pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies --\nto recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the\nF444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input\nparameters for simulated images with SNR $\\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF\nfraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD\ncompactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\\lesssim\n50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic\nextent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results\nfor increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely\nhigh-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and\ntwo-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock\nsample fitting. We find that $\\sim85\\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated,\nconsistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining $\\sim15\\%$ have\nlow estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $\\gtrsim 150$ pc\n(Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the\npopulation likely is not homogeneous.
