It was selected following a proposal call for science programs that would benefit from an early community-based definition (Sanderson et al 2024). The community was invited to submit white papers and science pitches with a deadline of May 20, 2024; the Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee (RGPS-DC) first met on Sep 11, 2024. Based on the input provided, the RGPS-DC recommends a survey consisting of three elements: (1) a wide-field science element (691 sq deg, 541 hrs) covering the Galactic plane, Galactic latitude |b|<2 deg and Galactic longitude l=+50.1 deg to -79 deg (281 deg), in four filters (F129, F159, F184, and F213) with higher latitude extensions for the bulge, the Serpens South/W40 star formation region, and Carina, (2) a time-domain science element (19 sq deg , 130 hrs) of six fields, including the full Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD) and Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), with coverage in seven filters and repeat observations in one or more filters with cadences from 11 minutes to weeks, and (3) a deep-field/spectroscopic science element (4 sq deg , 30 hrs) consisting of fifteen Roman pointings (with a wide range of extinction, diffuse emission, stellar density and population) using longer exposure times in seven filters in addition to grism and prism observations. This document summarizes the science that can be done with this survey, the process of survey definition, and details on all of the program elements."}

We present a data-driven method to identify this region in galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200\\rm ,mean}>10^{13} M_{\\odot}$ at $z = 0$. Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment."}

Despite growing samples, the physical drivers of this extreme variability, and the potential link to host-galaxy properties, remain unknown. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the transition between AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra offers a unique opportunity to study relations between AGNs and their hosts within the same objects. We present intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of 23 CL-AGNs identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V), obtained with VLT/X-shooter and Gemini-N/GMOS. An analysis of the Mgii emission line observed in the spectra demonstrates that the majority of these sources cannot be driven by variable obscuration. Our CL-AGNs roughly follow the M_BH-sigma_* and M_BH-M_* relations of inactive galaxies, with a median black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.38%, although they show hints of a shallower slope. We find no evidence that the stellar population properties of our CL-AGNs, including stellar mass, age, young stellar fraction, and star-formation rate differ from those of Type 2 AGNs in SDSS. These results suggest that CL-AGNs reside in typical AGN host galaxies and that their extreme variability is likely unrelated to host-galaxy environment, supporting the idea that CL-AGNs are not a distinct population, but rather represent a phase of normal AGN activity. This result, in turn, implies that CL-AGNs can serve as useful probes of the AGN-host connection, providing access to both AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra of the same systems."}

This transition stems from the constraints of the \"gram-scale weight reduction\" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding \"lightweight performance\" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with \"proton density\" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness <=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' \"mass savings\" and high-Z materials' \"space savings.\" When rho_p<1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p>1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions."}

We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}}$.

Associating entropy to gravitational fields has not remained limited to black holes, necessitating the notion of the second law of thermodynamics in gravitating systems. There have been many ideas and attempts to prove the second law in gravitational systems starting from first principles. Within the covariant phase space formalism, we define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with the local boosts, detaching the gravitational entropy from horizons or trapped surfaces. Our definition encompasses and generalizes the existing notions of entropy. Using this definition for the Einstein gravity case, we compute variations of the entropy along the path of any causal observer and establish that the entropy variations are always non-negative if the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition integrated along any segment of the causal path."}

GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5$σ$ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin$^2$ at $z \\sim 6$. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from $z \\sim 6$ up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of $\\sim 540$ galaxy candidates identified at $6 < z < 16$, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning $M_{\\mathrm UV}$ = $-$20 to $-$12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs.

This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description."}

This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes."}

Combining DES-Dovekie with CMB data from Planck, ACT and SPT and the DESI DR2 measurements in a Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmology, we find $w_0 = -0.803 \\pm 0.054$, $w_a = -0.72 \\pm 0.21$. Our results hold a significance of $3.2σ$, reduced from $4.2σ$ for DES-SN5YR, to reject the null hypothesis that the data are compatible with the cosmological constant. This significance is equivalent to a Bayesian model preference odds of approximately 5:1 in favour of the Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Using generally accepted thresholds for model preference, our updated data exhibits only a weak preference for evolving dark energy."}

The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit.

This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy.

The planned observatories will utilize electro-optic modulators (EOMs) to encode the onboard clock timing onto the beam phase. Recent research has demonstrated the advantage of introducing an optical frequency comb (OFC) in the metrology system with the modified framework of time-delay interferometry (TDI): the removal of the EOM and the simultaneous suppression of the stochastic jitter of the laser and the clock in the observation band. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach with the OFC-based metrology system. We report that after proper treatment, it is possible to use the measured carrier-carrier heterodyne frequencies to monitor the time derivative of the pseudoranges, which represent the physical light travel time and the clock difference. This approach does not require changing the existing TDI framework, as previous OFC based efforts did. We also present the experimental demonstration of our scheme using two separate systems to model two spacecraft. Using this novel approach, we synchronize the two independent phase measurement systems with an accuracy better than 0.47 ns, while the stochastic jitter in the observation band is suppressed down to the setup sensitivity around the LISA performance levels at 15 pm/sqrt(Hz)."}

Consequently, we show that under the current best-fit cosmological model no violation of the NEC takes place, past or future. Further, growth in the energy density of an individual component cannot be used to signal violation of the NEC. We illustrate these points with a worked example whereby misestimation of the matter density leads to a phase during which $ρ_{de} + P_{de} < 0$ for the effective dark energy, followed by a phantom crossing and subsequent $ρ_{de} + P_{de} > 0$. At no time is the NEC violated. We also introduce ``elephant'' and ``chimera'' classes of physics for crossing $w_{de}=-1$."}

Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally.

This allows us to identify Weyl-covariant structures in the solution space, including hierarchies of recursion relations encoding the flux-balance laws. We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance. This connection is naturally formulated within the Newman-Penrose formalism by performing a partially off-shell conformal compactification and identifying the analogue of the Ashtekar-Streubel symplectic structure in the radial expansion near the null hypersurface.

We aim to examine the breathing effect-the variability of emission line widths with continuum luminosity-beyond reverberation-mapped AGNs, to assess the validity and estimate potential systematic uncertainties of single-epoch virial black hole mass estimates. We construct an unprecedentedly large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of quasars from SDSS DR16, focusing on four key broad emission lines (Ha, Hb, MgII, and CIV). We assess how breathing behavior evolves with the rest-frame time interval between observations. We detect no significant breathing signal in Ha, Hb, or MgII at any observed timescale. In contrast, CIV exhibits a statistically significant anti-breathing trend, most prominent at intermediate timescales. Notably, for Hb, which has shown breathing in previous reverberation-mapped samples, we recover the effect only in the small subset of quasars with clearly detected BLR lags and only during the epochs when such lags are measurable-suggesting that both the lag and breathing signals are intermittent, possibly due to a weak correlation between optical and ionizing continua. These results highlight the complex, variable, and timescale-dependent nature of line profile variability and underscore its implications for single-epoch black hole mass estimates."}

To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \\text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.8} M_{\\odot}$ (m>5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.5} M_{\\odot}$ (m>6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The Milky Way harbours a prominent m=1 lopsided distortion in both stellar and neutral gas distributions. On the other hand, chemo-dynamical studies have been proven to be effective in grasping the overall evolution of galaxies. Here, we investigate systematically the excitation and evolution of a merger-driven $m=1$ lopsidedness in a Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxy, as a function of chemical distribution of stars. Using seven dissipationless, high-resolution $N$-body simulations of minor mergers (between a MW-like host and a satellite) under varying orbital configurations (prograde/retrograde and different orientation of the satellite orbital plane), we first show that a tidal interaction excites a prominent $m=1$ lopsidedness in the stellar density and velocity distribution of the MW-like host. Assigning, a posteriori, metallicities to stellar particles of the MW-like host based on the current observational constraints, we sub-divide the stars into metal-rich ([Fe/H] > 0), metal-intermediate (-0.5 < [Fe/H] <0), and metal-poor (- 0.5 < [Fe/H]) populations. We demonstrate that metal-rich population always show a much stronger $m=1$ lopsidedness in both density and velocity distributions when compared to other two populations. This trend holds true for all minor merger model considered here, regardless of their orbital configurations. Furthermore, minor merger also triggers a transient off-centred stellar disc-dark matter halo configuration, with metal-rich population showing the highest degree of disc-halo offset. We show that the metal-rich population which is kinematically colder (i.e. lower velocity dispersion) by construction, is more susceptible to external perturbations. Lastly, using a catalogue of photometry and metalicity for the LMC, we show that the strength of the $m=1$ distortion (predominantly in the form of an one-arm spiral) in stars increases with metallicity as well."}

Widely considered to be the sources of gravitational waves, binaries are expected to form as a natural consequence of galactic mergers and determining the processes that drive their evolution is essential for understanding cosmological evolution. In this work, we evaluate the prospects of using ground and spaceborne Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to observe supermassive black hole binaries and estimate their orbital parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is considered as the primary case study. Achieving unprecedented resolution, BHEX will provide access to a new volume of binary parameter space, potentially enabling the first, confident detection of an SMBHB. A binary toy model using a post-Newtonian orbit propagation is developed and simulated observations by BHEX and a ground array of telescopes are performed. An orbit fitting approach using Bayesian dynamic nested sampling is presented and its efficacy is demonstrated on the simulated observational data for a set of example binary systems. It is found that for BHEX, binary detection requires a total flux density of 0.04 Jy with a minimum separation of ~2 microarcseconds and an observable mass ratio dependent on the total flux. With three annual observations, BHEX could constrain semi-major axis and eccentricity of binaries with orbital periods <10 years to within 13% of the true values. A curved trajectory could confidently be detected in binaries with period <23 years. Proposals for how candidate sources could be identified in time for the BHEX mission are also provided. Finally, we constrain the requirements of a future spaceborne VLBI system, capable of performing a statistically significant survey of supermassive black hole binaries."}

We adopt a unified framework capable of describing both relativistic and non-relativistic particles, as well as fast and slow decay regimes. Within this approach, we model exponential, power-law, oscillatory, and two-step decays, computing the resulting $μ$- and $y$-type distortions across the parameter space spanned by the confinement scale $a_c$, decay rate $Γ_χ$, energy-transfer efficiency $Σ_χ$, and velocity $v_{χc}$. We find that power-law, oscillatory, and cascade decays can be effectively mapped onto exponential models with appropriate rescaling. The dominant factors controlling SDs are the decay epoch and lifetime, with $v_{χc}$ becoming relevant only in the ultra-relativistic limit. FIRAS observations impose tight constraints on early energy injection, with $μ$-type distortions placing the strongest bounds on $Σ_χ$. Simultaneous matching of both $μ_{\\rm firas}$ and $y_{\\rm firas}$ breaks the degeneracy between $Γ_χ$ and $Σ_χ$, localizing preferred decay rates around $Γ_χ\\lesssim (3.3-4.4)\\times10^{-3}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $Σ_χ\\lesssim 8.5\\times10^{-4}$ for relativistic particles, while fast decays with $Γ_χ\\gtrsim 6.5~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ become observationally negligible.

Revision submitted on November 6th, 2025", "summary": "Accurately modeling molecular hydrogen ($\\text{H}_{2}$) is an important task in cosmological simulations because it regulates star formation. One fundamental property of $\\text{H}_{2}$ is the ability to self-shield, a phenomenon in which the $\\text{H}_{2}$ in the outer layer of a molecular cloud absorbs the photodissociating Lyman-Werner UV radiation and shields the inner $\\text{H}_{2}$. Historically, numerical approximations have been utilized to avoid intensive ray-tracing calculations. This paper evaluates the use of the Sobolev-like density-gradient approximation in $\\text{H}_{2}$ self-shielding modeling and tests its agreement with a more rigorous adaptive ray-tracing method in cosmological simulations. We ran four high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations to investigate the models' effects in the early Reionization Era ($z \\geq 12$). We find that the approximation model returns a higher $\\text{H}_{2}$ photodissociation rate in low gas density environments but lower the rate when gas density is high, resulting in low-mass halos having less $\\text{H}_{2}$ while high-mass halos having more $\\text{H}_{2}$. The approximation also hinders star formation in small halos, but it less affects the stellar mass of larger halos. Inside a halo, the discrepancies between the two models regarding $\\text{H}_{2}$ fraction, temperature, and stellar mass are radially dependent. On a large scale, the simulations using the approximation have less $\\text{H}_{2}$ in the intergalactic medium and may experience a slower reionization process. These results show that the Sobolev-like approximation alters properties of galaxies and the large-scale universe when compared to the ray-tracing treatment, emphasizing a need for caution when interpreting results from these two techniques in cosmological simulations."}

However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations."}

The gluon spectrum is computed within the Improved Opacity Expansion, which accounts for both multiple soft and single hard momentum exchanges between the hard probe and the medium. The background evolution is obtained from effective kinetic theory simulations that determine the jet quenching parameter, which in turn controls the radiation rate. We compute the radiation rate for initially under- and over-occupied systems, as well as for an expanding system undergoing hydrodynamization, which typically represents the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. The results for these dynamical backgrounds are compared to static and thermally matched scenarios, allowing to gauge the importance of bulk expansion in the evolution of the jet cascade. Our findings show that the early stages of the bulk matter evolution in heavy-ion collisions leave a sizable imprint on the radiation pattern inside jets. These results establish a basis for incorporating pre-equilibrium dynamics into realistic descriptions of jet quenching and hard-probe evolution."}

We create a realistic simulated lens sample and test how uncertainties in redshift and velocity dispersion measurements affect results under ideal, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios. We find that increasing the sample size from 100 to 10,000 systems dramatically improves precision: in the $Λ$CDM model, the uncertainty on the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, drops from 0.2 to 0.01; in the $w$CDM model, the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $w$, decreases from 0.3 to 0.04. With 10,000 lenses, our constraints on dark energy are twice as tight as those from the latest DESI BAO measurements. We also compare two parameter estimation techniques -- MultiNest sampling and Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM). While both achieve similar precision, BHM provides more robust estimates of intrinsic lens parameters, whereas MultiNest is about twice as fast.

On this background we study linear perturbations of test fields with spins $s=0,1,2$ and compute their quasinormal spectra using both a high order WKB scheme and continued fraction method, complemented by time domain evolutions.

The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events.

In this work, using a particular low-scale neutrino mass model as an example, and by taking into account both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino fluxes, we show that RG running of the PMNS matrix can lead to an increased number of high-energy tau neutrino events at IceCube. This excess manifests as an increased number of spatially displaced showers called ``double bangs\".

For these purposes, spatially resolved measurements of the thermodynamic properties of intra-cluster medium (ICM), such as density and temperature, are necessary. In particular, temperature estimates are traditionally obtained through spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy. Such measurements suffer from their sensitivity to the chosen energy calibration, may exhibit inherent biases, and are especially hard to perform at high redshift as they require deep observations. In recent years however, millimetre wavelength data with high spatial resolution, comparable to the one of current X-ray telescopes, have begun to be available. This has enabled the implementation of new methods to infer and map the cluster temperature in individual clusters, using the combination of density maps from X-ray data and pressure maps from millimetre data. In this paper, we present the first systematic validation of this approach on a large sample of synthetic clusters generated in The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulations. We show that we are able to recover theoretical estimates of the temperature, namely the mass-weighted and spectroscopic-like temperatures, within biases of the order of $\\lesssim 1\\%$ in the best cases, up to $\\sim 10\\%$ in average, with scatters of the order of $10\\%$.\n  To prepare the application of this approach to observed data, we discuss the modelling of the effective length $l_\\mathrm{eff}$, a key quantity necessary for the combination of X-ray and SZ projected data.

Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes."}

The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry.

The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $α$-enhanced forms, are adopted.

This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description."}

Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift.

The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anti-correlation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement. These results provide useful insights into the underlying physics of changing-look AGNs and high-$z$ AGNs, such as the ``little red dots'', which exhibit extreme values of the Balmer decrement that can be misinterpreted as evidence for dust."}

The electron density distribution is chosen to preserve a generalized Carter constant. We explore the shadow cast by this class of rotating wormhole in the presence of both homogeneous and non homogeneous plasma as seen by an asymptotic observer. The photon regions are visualized, and the influence of geometric parameters, plasma parameters, and the observer inclination angle with the rotation axis on the resulting shadow morphology is analyzed. We tried to implement constraints on the plasma and the geometrical parameters of the wormhole such as the spin parameter and the deviation (from Kerr) parameter in the back drop of recent observational bounds coming from the deviation from circularity of the shadow boundary ($ΔC$) and deviation of the average shadow radius from Schwarzschild ($δ$). The bound on $ΔC$ is satisfied by the theoretically allowed range of parameters thus not found very useful to put any constraint, we could impose stringent constraints on the parameters based on the observed value of $δ$.

Comments greatly appreciated and warmly welcomed!", "summary": "Delayed reverberations of broad emission lines in response to optical continuum variations have been widely observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They serve as a powerful tool for probing inner structures of AGNs and estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The delays exhibit a strong correlation with approximately the square root of the optical luminosity - a relationship known as the \"standard structure\" of AGN broad-line regions (BLRs). Here, we report the discovery of leading delays in Hβ line reverberations (LDRs) in the quasar PHL 1092 preceding variations of the 5100 Å continuum by 17-57 days, based on our eight-year continuous campaign of reverberation mapping of super Eddington AGNs. The LDRs suggest that the 5100 Å continuum regions are so extensive that they are larger than the BLRs. This phenomenon not only fundamentally disrupts the well-established BLR size-luminosity relation but also violates the principle of causality. This unprecedented LDRs challenge the conventional methods for estimating SMBH mass as well as the standard model of AGNs. A preferred scenario to explain the LDRs is that the SMBH-disk contains a population of accreting stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) as extra heating sources of the disk. Consequently, continuum regions of the disk are efficiently stretched so that the 5100 Å regions exceed the BLRs, yielding the observed LDRs. Generally, sMBH activities there could provide new physics of AGN phenomena, which can be tested by LIGO, LISA/Tianqin and ET detections of gravitational waves from sMBH mergers."}

From geodesic equations, we derive observable geometric quantities that can be directly compared with VLBI/VLBA astrometry, the Cassini time-delay measurement, MESSENGER data and the GP-B/LLR results.

Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs."}

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case."}

The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm."}

The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%).

We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys.

Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment."}

We find that the noncommutative parameter $Θ$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $Θ$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector.

We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm."}

The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts.

Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally.

To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries."}

The planned observatories will utilize electro-optic modulators (EOMs) to encode the onboard clock timing onto the beam phase. Recent research has demonstrated the advantage of introducing an optical frequency comb (OFC) in the metrology system with the modified framework of time-delay interferometry (TDI): the removal of the EOM and the simultaneous suppression of the stochastic jitter of the laser and the clock in the observation band. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach with the OFC-based metrology system. We report that after proper treatment, it is possible to use the measured carrier-carrier heterodyne frequencies to monitor the time derivative of the pseudoranges, which represent the physical light travel time and the clock difference. This approach does not require changing the existing TDI framework, as previous OFC based efforts did. We also present the experimental demonstration of our scheme using two separate systems to model two spacecraft. Using this novel approach, we synchronize the two independent phase measurement systems with an accuracy better than 0.47 ns, while the stochastic jitter in the observation band is suppressed down to the setup sensitivity around the LISA performance levels at 15 pm/sqrt(Hz)."}

Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes."}

Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \\texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs."}

This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy. This picture predicts that QCD string axions exist only if the gauge group is $SU(N\\geq 3)$, $SO(4N+2)$, or $E_6$ (or a quotient/double-cover thereof), and is absent from the spectrum of stable QCD strings if the gauge group is $SU(2)$, $SO(2N+1)$, $SO(4N)$, $Sp(N)$, or $E_7$.

The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm."}

We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys.

Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion.
