For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, Rényi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and Rényi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law."}

We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $Λ(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $Λ$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $Λ$.

In this work, we generalize the embedding procedure to slices with arbitrary polar angles $θ\\neq π/2$, thereby extending the visualization and analysis of spacetimes beyond the reach of traditional methods.\n  The formalism is applied to Schwarzschild-like wormholes and to a generalized Minkowski spacetime with angular deficit or excess, which are particularly relevant since their equatorial slices cannot be consistently embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In these cases, we identify the explicit constraints on the radial coordinate, polar angle, and geometric parameters required to guarantee consistent embeddings into three-dimensional Euclidean space."}

We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $τ_{echo2}>τ_{CDS}>τ_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results.

Our framework applies in any spacetime dimension and across arbitrarily many two-particle cuts, including cases where the kinematic Riemann surface becomes infinitely sheeted.

However, conventional approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in imaginary time are limited, as they do not allow real time evolution and suffer from a sign problem in many important cases. Using Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) as a variational ground state ansatz offers an alternative for studying LGTs through a sign-problem-free variational MC. As this method is extended to larger and more complex systems, understanding its numerical behavior becomes essential. While conventional action based MC has been extensively studied, the performance and characteristics of non-action-based MC within the GGFPEPS framework are far less explored. In this work, we investigate these algorithmic aspects, identifying an optimal update size for GGFPEPS-based MC simulations for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $2+1$ dimensions. We show that gauge fixing generally slows convergence, and demonstrate that not exploiting the translation-invariance can, in some cases, improve the computational time scaling of error convergence.

Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile."}

Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\\sim -9\\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation.

The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions. The unique capabilities of HWO will make it the first facility capable of characterizing true exo-Jupiters in reflected light, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to place the Solar System in a broader galactic context."}

From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \\le z \\le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling."}

The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $π_{s\\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $π$, $π_{s \\bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $π$, $π_{s\\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $π$, $π_{s\\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs).

However, by searching in many directions all at once, the statistical power of these search strategies is diluted by a variant of the look elsewhere effect. We examine this challenge in detail, focusing on weakly supervised methods. We find that training and testing on the same data results in badly miscalibrated $p$-values due to the anomaly detector searching everywhere in the data and overfitting on statistical fluctuations. However, if these $p$-values can be calibrated, they may offer the best sensitivity to anomalies, since this approach uses all of the data. Conversely, training on half of the data and testing on the other half results in perfectly calibrated $p$-values, but at the cost of reduced sensitivity to anomalies. Similarly, regularization methods such as early stopping can help with $p$-value calibration but also possibly at the expense of sensitivity. Finally, we find that k-folding strikes an effective balance between calibration and sensitivity. Our findings are supported by numerical studies with Gaussian random variables as well as from collider physics using the LHC Olympics benchmark anomaly detection dataset."}

Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade."}

Importantly, its parameter degeneracy directions differ from those of shear, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, making it a complementary and consistency-check probe with substantial diagnostic value for the next decade of precision cosmology.

They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\\leq10\\,M_\\odot$ regime.

The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations."}

We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement."}

We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions."}

The analysis is performed within the weak-coupling approximation and utilizes known results for the fermion damping rates in the Landau-level representation, $Γ_{n}(p_{z})$, which are dominated by one-to-two and two-to-one processes in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The transverse and longitudinal components of the viscosities are derived using Kubo's linear response theory. Our results reveal a pronounced anisotropy in both shear and bulk viscosities induced by the magnetic field. In the case of an electron-positron plasma, where the weak-coupling approximation is well justified, the dimensionless longitudinal shear viscosity $η_{\\parallel}/T^3$ increases rapidly with the magnetic field strength, while the transverse component $η_{\\perp}/T^3$ decreases and can even drop below the KSS bound at sufficiently large fields. In contrast, both the dimensionless longitudinal and transverse bulk viscosities, $ζ_{\\perp}/T^3$ and $ζ_{\\parallel}/T^3$, initially rise from small values, reach a maximum, and then gradually decrease toward zero. We find that the bulk viscosity is highly sensitive to the longitudinal and transverse components of the sound velocity, particularly at high magnetic fields, indicating that its quantitative values should be interpreted with caution. We also calculate an additional cross viscosity, which is negative and whose magnitude increases with the magnetic field strength. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of these magnetoviscosity results in the contexts of magnetar physics and the strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions."}

Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc.

Key features of gravitational path integrals--most notably Euclidean wormholes and the associated failure of factorization--lack a clear interpretation in the standard large-$N$ framework. A related challenge is the possibility of erratic $N$-dependence in CFT observables, behavior with no evident semiclassical gravitational counterpart.\n  We argue that these puzzles point to a missing ingredient in the dictionary: a large-$N$ filter. This filter projects out the erratic $N$-dependence of CFT quantities when mapping them to semiclassical bulk physics, providing an intrinsic boundary definition of gravitational \"averages.\" It also offers a boundary explanation of wormhole contributions and a boundary prediction of their amplitudes, thereby giving a natural resolution of the factorization puzzle. In addition, we derive an infinite tower of inequalities constraining wormhole amplitudes and argue that internal wormholes do not induce random couplings in the low-energy effective theory.\n  Beyond resolving factorization, the large-$N$ filter supplies a generalized framework from which richer Lorentzian spacetime structures can emerge, including closed universes and black hole interiors. We argue that, as a consequence of erratic large-$N$ behavior, both closed universes and black hole interiors are quantum volatile, and that an AdS spacetime entangled with a baby universe is likewise quantum volatile. This volatility may allow an observer in AdS to infer the existence of the baby universe, whereas for an infalling observer, the ability to make measurements near a black hole horizon may become fundamentally limited--even if they may not live long enough to notice."}

These ``gravitational Abelian instantons\" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $θ$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $θ$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes."}

While previous studies have extensively investigated the production of dark matter through the decay of heavy particles, they overlook the cosmological role of the decaying mediator without justifying this assumption. We emphasize that the mediator can dominate the energy budget of the early universe during its decay, leading to an unavoidable early matter-dominated era. This intrinsic matter-dominated phase influences dark matter production in two key ways: (i) dark matter production occurs in both the early radiation and induced matter-dominated phases; specifically, considerable production occurs in the matter-dominated phase and stops when the mediator decays fully, and (ii) it causes dilution in dark matter abundance due to entropy injection before its saturation. Furthermore, this effect significantly alters the gravitational wave signature associated with the production of freeze-in dark matter through graviton emission during the mediator's decay. Specifically, it enhances the gravitational wave spectrum, making it viable for future high-frequency gravitational wave experiments."}

Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit."}

Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization."}

These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability.

We obtained bulk velocity shifts delta_v = -0.048 pm 0.028 km/s and -0.13 pm 0.14 km/s (1 sigma confidence level) between CH and H2O in the direction of PKS1830-211(NE) and B0218+357(SW), respectively. These values convert into the 3sigma upper limits |Delta_alpha/alpha| < 0.55 ppm and 1.5 ppm, respectively, taking into account the independent upper limits on |Delta_mu/mu| previously obtained for these systems. These constraints on |Delta_alpha/alpha|, at look-back times of about half the present age of the Universe, are two to four times deeper than previous constraints on any other single high-z system."}

However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups."}

They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources. Interestingly, even with the present precision of the data, the Relativistic Precession Model seems to be less suitable compared to the Tidal Disruption Model for the sources GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226.

Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance."}

Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21\\,cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21\\,cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21\\,cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\\mathrm{CII}]$--21\\,cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$σ$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)--21\\,cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters.

These mathematical constructions provide the essential tools for general relativity, in which the curvature of spacetime;described by the Einstein field equations;is most elegantly formulated using the Cartan calculus of differential forms. Another important subject in this discussion is the notion of conformal geometry, where the relevant invariants of a metric are characterized by Elie Cartan's normal conformal connection. The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable. Defined by a central Pfaffian system, this formulation allows the entire spacetime geometry to be reconstructed from a single scalar function, $Z$, whose level surfaces are null."}

In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers."}

Both valence spin-antialigned ($\\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $π$, $π_{s \\bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $π$, $π_{s\\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $π$, $π_{s\\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs).

We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\\rm 2.04 \\pm 0.32 \\times 10^{-4} \\space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\\rm A_V = 0.21 \\pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations."}

Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(φ, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{cφ}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T > T_{cφ}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $α_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $γ$ and for $N \\approx 50\\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72γ$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $σ^2$ and the coupling $γ$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics.

Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response.

PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\\dot{m}_{\\rm BH}/\\dot{m}_{\\rm edd} \\sim 1-10\\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\\odot\\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered \"little red dots\"."}

We find the evolution is correctly reproduced for all the dynamical variables, and the energy and momentum constraints are well-satisfied. This demonstrates that the stochastic equations are theoretically and numerically robust and ready to be applied to a wider inflationary landscape. Our simulations result in real space realizations of the fully non-linear stochastic dynamics with gradient information retained.

Our black brane solutions carry two kinds of gauge charges but still are exact, which extends the recent developments in classification of heterotic branes. The solutions offer a novel method to embed previously known noncritical 2-D or 3-D solutions to the critical dimensions. Furthermore, by performing a perturbative analysis of the non-Abelian gauge field on this exact background, we analytically find that as the temperature decreases, a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to a dynamical instability accompanied by gauge field condensation. This instability embodies a phase transition of black branes in heterotic supergravity, and analytically predicts the existence of unknown black hole solutions to be unveiled. Our results suggest that phase transition phenomena can be used to explore and analyze the phase structure of black hole solutions, for systematically discovering and classifying stringy black holes."}

In this paper, we present a systematic theoretical study of the groomed substructures for both inclusive jets and photon-tagged jets ($γ+$jets) utilizing the Dynamical and Soft-Drop Grooming algorithms in PbPb collisions by employing the SHELL transport model. Our theoretical calculations exhibit a suppression at high $k_{\\rm T,g}$, the relative transverse momentum between the two subjets in the groomed substructure, consistent with the recent ALICE measurements. We show that the suppression of high $k_{\\rm T,g}$ arises from the combined effects of the reduction of the subleading subjet transverse momentum due to partonic energy loss and the narrowing of the groomed jet radius $R_g$ induced by selection bias. Our findings demonstrate that no enhancement is observed at high $k_{\\rm T,g}$, even in the complete absence of selection bias. Furthermore, we propose that the broadening of $R_g$ in photon-tagged jets, which are less susceptible to selection bias compared to inclusive jets, provides relatively direct evidence of the jet substructure broadening. Our analysis reveals that the $R_g$ broadening becomes more pronounced as the jet radius increases, where the medium-induced gluon radiation plays a dominant role in driving such broadening. In particular, we find that as the jet radius increases, the Soft Drop grooming algorithm exhibits a better resolving power for the contribution of the medium response to the jet substructure broadening."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC<0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies."}

Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling."}

Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum. This ``cosmic lockdown'' mechanism is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect: environmental monitoring stabilizes enhanced false-vacuum occupation for light fields by preventing them from tunneling."}

The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core.

We derive these results using first principles application of Noether's method as well as covariant phase space methods.

The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 > 1.74 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 > \\mathcal{O}(10^{6})\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope.

The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations."}

However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs)."}

In this paper, we explore the Swampland Conjectures through the lens of holography, focusing on how holographic consistency conditions, such as the convexity of the conformal field theory (CFT) spectrum, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), and the modular bootstrap, map onto Swampland constraints in the bulk. We argue that the holographic principle provides a geometric realization of Swampland bounds, particularly on scalar field potentials and the absence of long-lived de Sitter vacua. Finally, we discuss how the emergent bulk locality in AdS/CFT provides evidence that the Swampland conjectures may themselves be manifestations of deeper holographic consistency conditions."}

Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance."}

Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \\textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects.

Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \\le z \\le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling."}

Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data"}

Specifically, in the context of 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory we show that there exist Euclidean field configurations that have finite action, are asymptotically flat, and feature non-zero electromagnetic second Chern number. These ``gravitational Abelian instantons\" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $θ$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $θ$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes."}

Some outflows show discrete clumps of cold molecular gas moving at extremely high velocities (EHVs) of $\\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$, known as ''molecular bullets'', that are likely closely associated with their primary driving agent. Here we present ALMA CO(J=3-2) observations of a bright EHV molecular bullet that reveal its morphology in detail down to scales of 30 au and its kinematic structure across the entire intermediate velocity range ($\\sim$30-100 km s$^{-1}$). These provide important new insights into how outflows transfer mass and momentum to the surrounding medium. The observed channel maps display several sequences of ring-like features whose velocity increases and size decreases with projected distance from the driving source, each sequence tracing a thin, bow-shaped shell culminating on-axis in a bright EHV head. The shape, kinematics, and mass of each shell all agree remarkably well with the simplest textbook models of momentum-conserving bowshocks produced by a time-variable EHV jet. The dynamical timescale between consecutive shells is of a few decades, with the latest ejection event coinciding with the protostar optical/IR outburst observed in $\\sim$1990. The very strong evidence for bowshock-driven entrainment induced by jet variability revealed by this work suggests that accretion bursts, and therefore variations in the disk snowlines, should occur on decade timescales, which could substantially impact grain growth and planet formation."}

Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(φ, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{cφ}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T > T_{cφ}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $α_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $γ$ and for $N \\approx 50\\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72γ$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $σ^2$ and the coupling $γ$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics. These results demonstrate that a confinement-inspired potential can naturally reproduce the observed inflationary phenomenology and offer a novel bridge between early-universe cosmology and the nonperturbative sector of QCD."}

Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$.

In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers."}

Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum. This ``cosmic lockdown'' mechanism is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect: environmental monitoring stabilizes enhanced false-vacuum occupation for light fields by preventing them from tunneling."}

We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $τ_{echo2}>τ_{CDS}>τ_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results.

In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies."}

Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(φ, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{cφ}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T > T_{cφ}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $α_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $γ$ and for $N \\approx 50\\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72γ$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $σ^2$ and the coupling $γ$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics.

The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\\rm MHz}}<11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer."}

Our results complete the calculation of beyond Standard Model effects in non-leptonic, tree-level, $b$-quark decays relevant for $B$ meson lifetimes and lifetime ratios such as $τ(B^0_s)/τ(B^0_d)$. Such effects naturally arise in extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that aim to address the observed tensions between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions based on QCD factorisation in several colour-allowed non-leptonic $B$-meson decays. As a by-product of our calculation, we also determine the matching coefficients in the HQE induced by the QCD-penguin operators within the SM, including both the interference between current-current and penguin operators and the contributions quadratic in the penguin operators. Owing to the suppression of the QCD-penguin Wilson coefficients within the SM, these effects are typically regarded as corrections of order $α_s$ and $α_s^2$ in the strong coupling, respectively.

We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$.

A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger.\n  Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures."}

In this paper, we explore the Swampland Conjectures through the lens of holography, focusing on how holographic consistency conditions, such as the convexity of the conformal field theory (CFT) spectrum, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), and the modular bootstrap, map onto Swampland constraints in the bulk. We argue that the holographic principle provides a geometric realization of Swampland bounds, particularly on scalar field potentials and the absence of long-lived de Sitter vacua. Finally, we discuss how the emergent bulk locality in AdS/CFT provides evidence that the Swampland conjectures may themselves be manifestations of deeper holographic consistency conditions."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\\pm0.7\\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics."}

We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \\textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\\sim2^{\\prime\\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture.

HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box -- a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference.

Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade."}

We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions."}

These ``gravitational Abelian instantons\" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $θ$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $θ$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes."}

Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization."}

Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling."}

In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers."}

Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories."}

Since a domain wall causes the parity violation, the transmitted gravitational waves also exhibit the parity violation. We calculate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves. It turns out that gravitational waves after going through the domain wall could be chiral. Remarkably, the degree of circular polarization does not depend on the tension of the domain wall."}

Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit."}

Pimentel"], "title": "Primordial features and low-$\\ell$ suppression from isocurvature modes in multi-field Higgs-$R^2$ inflation", "comment": null, "summary": "We study primordial perturbations in Higgs-$R^2$ inflation in the presence of a non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs and the scalaron. By performing a full numerical integration of the multifield background and linear perturbations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the non-minimal coupling $ξ_h$. For $ξ_h \\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, the turning rate of the inflationary trajectory induces transient multifield effects that imprint localized features in the scalar power spectrum. In the limit $ξ_h\\ll 1$, the adiabatic spectrum becomes featureless, but isocurvature modes fail to fully decay, leaving a residual contribution at the end of inflation. We compute CMB angular power spectra TT, TE, EE and show how these regimes yield distinct observational signatures, delineating the parameter space compatible with current bounds. Our results highlight that suppressing spectral features does not guarantee the elimination of isocurvature perturbations, placing non-trivial constraints on Higgs-$R^2$ multifield realizations and motivating future probes sensitive to primordial isocurvature."}

The associated tensor spectral index is shown to be given, under minimal assumptions, by a simple formula easy to use in most situations of accelerated expansion. For slow-roll inflation, the induced spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, with an index that slightly deviates from the standard outcome of vacuum generated gravitational waves. Remarkably, we demonstrate that scale invariance remains true regardless of the original spectrum of the source."}

The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 > 1.74 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 > \\mathcal{O}(10^{6})\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope. Importantly, we find that flavour effects rescue regions of the parameter space that are ruled out due to current CMB or gravitational wave measurements."}
