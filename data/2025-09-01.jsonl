Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the\nMKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing\nphotons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically\nfeasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon\nsphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing\nobservables including the image position $\\theta_\\infty$, angular separation\n$s$ and relative magnification $r_{\\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships\nwith the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic\nimage's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing\nobservables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with\n$a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from\n$10.8~\\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two\nimages increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*,\nthe image position increases from $14.4~\\mu$as to $16~\\mu$as, with time delays\nenhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification\n$r_{\\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at\n$B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool\nto probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and\nin particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on\nthe parameters $a$ and $B$."}

Modeling these systems requires evolving the\ncoupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting\nreasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself\nrelies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this\npaper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories\nshape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger\nevents. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of\ndark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been\naccreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a\ndistribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from\na vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly\nfor more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place\nwithin a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find\nthat the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior\ninspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the\nenvironmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial\ndata are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors."}

It naturally follows that the optical design can force filter\nghosts to fall between detectors. When dealing with well-focused,\nhigh-intensity beams, first and second order stray light path analyses must be\nconducted to determine scattered light from glints off of individual\noptics/opto-mechanics or detector specific vane structures.

This\nsteeper slope arises from the interplay between scattering and the dust disk\nbecoming more extended over time (changes in star-dust geometry). At higher\ninclination, scattering is suppressed, and the attenuation curves slightly\nsteepen over time due to small-grain formation and the bias of observed UV\nlight toward older stars. The bump strengthens on a timescale of ~250 Myr due\nto the formation of small carbonaceous grains. The bump strength is affected\nnot only by the abundance of small grains but also by star-dust geometry. At\nhigher $A_V$ or higher inclination, the bump weakens. These results may help\ninterpret flatter attenuation curves and weaker bumps in high-redshift\ngalaxies. Variations in star-dust geometry alter the amount of scattered\nphotons escaping the galaxy, driving the anti-correlation between the slope and\n$A_V$. Scatter in this relation arises from differences in dust optical depth\nalong and perpendicular to the line of sight, reflecting inclination and\nstar-dust geometry.

What physical processes underlier the\nmorphologies we observe and is a galaxy's internal structure driving its\nevolution (nature) or is it a sign of the external processes which drive galaxy\nevolution (nurture)? We aim to understand the color dichotomy and gradients in\nbulges and disks along the Hubble sequence. We fit S\\'ersic functions to the 2D\nlight distributions in the $g$, $r$, $i$ bands to bulges and disks of the large\nEFIGI sample of galaxies with high quality morphological classification. In\nearly-type galaxies, bulges and disks have similarly red and nearly uniform\ncolors. Disks become significantly bluer with increasing lateness of their\ntypes and bulges get slightly redder because of patchy dust. Disks have\nincreasingly blue colors with increasing radius, whereas dust extinction and\nscattering leads to smaller effective radii of the bulges and lower steepness\nof the best-fit S\\'ersic profiles in $g$ versus $i$. The impact is not uniform\nwith Hubble type and the bulges of intermediate-type spirals (Sb-Sc) have the\nreddest mean colors, the largest scatter in their colors, and show the largest\nmean and scatter in their color gradients. Disks of the intermediate-type\ngalaxies show the strongest color gradients. We interpret these properties of\nthe bulges and disks of intermediate-type spirals as being due to dust\nextinction and scattering which we hypothesize to be an indicator of the gas\ncontent and inflow of gas. if early-type galaxies do evolve from massive spiral\ngalaxies, typically intermediate-type spirals, these color gradients are signs\nof in-situ stellar growth within their bulges, likely driven by morphological\nstructure in their disk.

In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a\nsubset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN\nfeedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars,\ndark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and\nbaryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the\nobserved $z \\approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black\nhole masses in massive galaxies.

The glueball GFFs are compared with those\nof other hadrons as determined in previous lattice calculations, providing\nstrong indications that glueballs have a different gluonic structure than\ntypical hadronic states. A mass radius of 0.263(31) fm is predicted, supporting\nprevious suggestions that the scalar glueball is significantly smaller than\nother hadrons. These results point towards a potential smoking-gun\ncharacteristic to target by experimental glueball searches."}
