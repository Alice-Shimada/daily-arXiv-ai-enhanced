Previous studies have suggested that\nseveral MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of\nsatellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given\nthat many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation.

However, as we\nsubtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower\ndistance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the\nstreams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction\nsimilar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole\ndistribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the\norbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole\ndistribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample,\nwe infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to\nbe affected by precession.

The advent of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will increase the\ncollecting area by more than an order of magnitude compared to the individual\nUnit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Fainter spectrophotometric\nstandard stars than those currently available in the V = 11 to 13 mag (K = 12\nto 14 mag) range are required for spectroscopic observations with instruments\nsuch as the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) on the ELT,\nnotably in the near-infrared wavelength regime. Aims. We identify suitable\nspectrophotometric standard stars among white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres\n(DA white dwarfs) in the magnitude range K =14 to 16 mag and provide reference\ndata based on stellar model atmospheres. Methods. We observed 24 candidate DA\nwhite dwarfs with the X-shooter instrument on the VLT, covering the wavelength\nrange 300 nm to 2480 nm in three arms. We took care to include stars at\nlatitudes below and above -25 degrees to allow observations for all wind\ndirections at the location of the ELT. The spectra were analysed using model\nfluxes from 3D pure-hydrogen local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres\nand multi-band photometry. From the sample of observed targets, we selected 14\nreliable flux calibrators.

We provide\nstrong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based\non their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777\ngalaxies spans $1 < z < 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST\nCOSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that\nthese dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\\mathrm{SFR \\sim\n40M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot}) =\n10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full\nJWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that\nred galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \\% of galaxies with\n$\\log(M/M_{\\odot}) > 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\\% by $z \\sim 7$ (albeit\nwith large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the\nnumber density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 6$ is sufficient\nto explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$, consistent with\ntypical quenching timescales allowed in the $\\mathrm{\\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from\n$z \\sim 6$ to $z \\sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial\ncontribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \\sim 4$, red\ngalaxies provide $\\mathrm {\\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \\times 10^{-2}\nM_{\\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \\sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \\% of the\ntotal $\\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected\ndusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude.

However, contrary to what was commonly\nassumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much\nlarger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the\nsuperposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems\nwhose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very\npromising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this\nwork, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant\nformalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account\nfor the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings\nwith external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the\n(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when\nattainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in\nterms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When\nthis decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even\nwith couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We\nthen apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of\nquantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)\ncharged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our\nclocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix\n$\\rho_{\\tau_2|\\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields\nnot only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical\nexpected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum\nfluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u949f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u949f\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6bd4\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u949f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u53d8\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b2c\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u949f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u901f\u65f6\u949f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u91cf\u5b50\u949f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u949f\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e3a\u6b63\u8d1f\u8d28\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u6027\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5728\u8003\u8651\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u949f\u65f6\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5339\u914d\u7ecf\u5178\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u9884\u671f\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u76f8\u5e72\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u949f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\u63a2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u51c6\u5907\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5339\u914d\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u56f4\u7ed5\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u3002"}}

Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS\nevolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our\nanalysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar\npopulations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized\nemission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival\ninfrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We\nderive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct\nfilament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization\nintensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation\nbetween B-fields and filaments.\n  As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF),\nPF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also\nincreases in size.
