We report on tuning the gauge\nanisotropy and the lattice spacing of anisotropic pure gauge ensembles with the\ntree-level Symanzik-improved action using the gradient flow and compare various\ntuning schemes. We also discuss the simultaneous tuning of the strange quark\nmass and the quark anisotropy with aHISQ, using spectrum measurements on\nquenched ensembles. We compare different ways to tune the quark anisotropy and\ndiscuss pion taste splittings for aHISQ at anisotropies up to 8.

However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for\nexternal galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day\nradii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar\nradial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates.\nIn the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated\nby 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading\nimpression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very\ncentral bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a\nnet inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk,\nmigration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are\noverestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward,\nwhereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they\nthemselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed\nand broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically\nunderestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have\ndirect implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys\nsuch as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for\nstellar birth sites.

We implemented\na neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in\nthe RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag\nsource term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a\nRiemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical\ndust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the\ncapacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse\ndown to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large\ndust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The\nspatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust\nenrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the\nenvelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial\nturbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal\nvelocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it\nto regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the\ncoupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the\ndynamical scales.

By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic\ntime, we find that only 40\\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z =\n1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most\ndominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at\nhigh redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The\nhierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive\nhaloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing\nrapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse\nevolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience\nsteady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes.

In this work, we\npropose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established\nmagnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the\nlarge-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature\npower spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses\nthat can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating\ntemperature range, $10^5\\,\\mathrm{GeV} \\leq T_{re} \\leq 3\\times\n10^5\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the\nentirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a\nstochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH\nformation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the\nsensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA,\nDECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH\ngeneration mechanism."}

Their effect is quantified mainly\nby means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\\zeta_2$.\n  Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass\nstarless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average\nlevel of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the\nenvironment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and\nCorona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus\ncloud and the other isolated cores we targeted.\n  Methods: We compute $\\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column\ndensity} of ortho-$\\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of\nHCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity\nmolecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment\n(APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel.\n  Results: We report $\\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide\nupper limits on the three remaining sources.

In this work, we identify the\naxion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions.
