We consider a\ngeneric process involving quark-antiquark annihilation, followed by the\nemission of a highly energetic virtual photon decaying into a dilepton pair.\nFor this process, we compute the dilepton emission rate from the imaginary part\nof the photon polarization tensor, at finite temperature and vorticity. Our\nresults show that vorticity induces characteristic modifications in the light\ndilepton channel, namely $e^-e^+$ production, where the emission spectrum\nexhibits a suppression at low transverse mass together with a mild shift of the\nproduction threshold. This behavior originates from the role of vorticity as an\neffective spin-dependent chemical potential that alters the available\nphase-space distribution for the emission process. In contrast, the\n$\\mu^-\\mu^+$ channel is essentially insensitive to the rotational background,\nthus remaining dominated by its intrinsic mass threshold. The resulting channel\ndependence highlights a potential phenomenological handle for disentangling\nrotational effects in heavy-ion collisions: while light dilepton spectra encode\nthe imprints of vorticity in the infrared sector, the muon channel provides a\ncomparatively robust baseline."}

However, because\nthese analyses are conditioned on galaxy positions, the inferred electron\ndistributions remain biased by uncertain galaxy-halo modeling on small scales.\nIn this work, we present a novel kSZ$\\times$galaxy four-point estimator that\ndirectly probes the full ionized electron field, extending beyond the gas\ntraced by luminous galaxies. This method exploits large-scale velocity\nreconstruction from galaxy surveys to characterize the electron distribution\nunbiased by small-scale galaxy clustering. We forecast that the proposed signal\ncan be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim3$ ($\\sim13$) for a\nconfiguration corresponding to Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 (Simons\nObservatory) CMB data combined with spectroscopic galaxy samples from DESI.\nThis approach will enable the first tomographic measurements of the electron\nauto-power spectrum, providing new constraints on baryonic feedback and its\nrole in shaping cosmic structure."}

In contrast to the fluid particles of this perfect fluid\nspacetime which follow non-geodesic world-lines and escape to infinity, we\nprove that freely-falling test particles of McVittie spacetime can reach the\nblack hole horizon in finite proper time. We review the relevant evidence and\nargue that the fate of an extended test body is less clear. More precisely: we\nconsider expanding McVittie spacetimes with a non-negative cosmological\nconstant. In each member of this class, we identify a region of the spacetime\nsuch that an observer following an initially-ingoing timelike geodesic crosses\nthe black hole horizon of the spacetime in a finite amount of proper time. The\ncurvature behaves in interesting ways along these geodesics. In the case of a\npositive cosmological constant, curvature scalars (of zero, first and second\norder in derivatives), Jacobi fields and parallel propagated (p.p.) frame\ncomponents of the curvature remain finite along timelike geodesics running into\nthe black hole horizon. For a vanishing cosmological constant, scalar curvature\nterms of zero and first order as well as Jacobi fields remain finite in this\nlimit. However, scalar curvature terms of second order diverge, and we show\nthat there are p.p.\\ frame components of the curvature tensor that also diverge\nin this limit. We argue that this casts a doubt as to whether or not an\nextended test body can survive crossing the black hole horizon in this case."}

By applying the FIREFLY software\nto the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar\npopulation properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous\nvariation in properties is found between a group that is still building up\n(XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically\ncomplex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104).

Detection of cis-formic acid in TMC-1 and astrochemical modeling", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The presence of molecular isomers in interstellar environments has become a\ntopic of growing interest within the astrochemical community. Contrary to\npredictions based on thermodynamic equilibrium, recent observations reveal a\ndiverse array of high-energy isomers and conformers. One of the most iconic\nmolecular isomers detected in space, formic acid (HCOOH, FA), has been the\nfocus of extensive theoretical research aimed at understanding its speciation\ninto cis and trans conformers in dark clouds and photodissociation regions. In\nthis work, we report the detection of c-FA, the higher-energy conformer, using\nultrasensitive observations of TMC-1. This detection adds to previous findings\nin the Barnard-5 and L483 dark clouds. The derived trans-to-cis isomer ratio in\nTMC-1, 17.5, closely matches those observed in other sources, suggesting that\nthe same chemical processes are at play across these environments. To\ninvestigate this, we conducted detailed astrochemical gas-grain models tailored\nto formic acid isomerism to explain the observed ratios. Our models\nsuccessfully reproduce the observed trans/cis ratios and indicate that the\npresence of cis-formic acid can be attributed to the release of c-FA from\ngrains, followed by isomerization driven by the excess energy released during\nthe desorption process, a process that we name as isomerization upon\ndesorption. The models also show that the isomerization of t-FA to c-FA in the\ngas phase is negligible at 10 K, meaning the observed ratios are a direct\nconsequence of the formation pathways of both isomers on the surface of dust\ngrains. However, at higher temperatures, quantum tunneling mediated direct\nisomerization in the gas becomes significant, and the ratios converge toward\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium value."}

On\nthe other hand the positive geometry program delegate the role of Feynman\ngraphs as secondary to the amplitude itself, which are generated by canonical\nforms associated to positive geometries. State of the art in this program is\nthe convergence of S-matrix theory in local QFTs and string theory as the\nscattering amplitudes in QFT arise as integrals over certain moduli spaces.\nThese integrals are known as curve integrals.

These maps are used to trace the radial\nevolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 $\\mu$m, which is\nemitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs ($<100$ carbon atoms). The\nfractional contribution of PAH 3.3 $\\mu$m to the total PAH luminosity\n($\\Sigma$PAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from $\\sim$1$\\%$\nto $\\sim$3$\\%$ over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from\nthe inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore\nmodel refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution\nprescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction\nremains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed $\\sim55$\ncarbon atoms.

Measuring electron\ntemperature through auroral-to-strong line ratios is a direct approach to\nderiving metallicity. However, there is a longstanding discrepancy between\nmetallicity measured through the direct method and that based on the\nphotoionization models. This paper aims to verify and understand the\ndiscrepancies. We bin ~ 1.5 million spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA according to\nmetallicity and ionization parameters derived from theoretical strong-line\ncalibrations. We stack the spectra of spaxels within each bin and measure the\nflux of strong lines and faint auroral lines. Auroral lines for [OII], [SII],\n[OIII], and [SIII] are detected in the stacked spectra of most bins, and the\n[NII] auroral line is detected in fewer bins. We apply an empirical method to\ncorrect dust attenuation, which makes more realistic corrections for low\nionization lines. We derive electron temperatures for these five ionic species\nand measure the oxygen and sulfur abundances using the direct method. We\npresent the resulting abundance measurements and compare them with those\nmodel-calibrated strong-line abundances. The chemical abundances measured with\nthe direct method are lower than those derived from the photoionization model,\nwith a median of 0.09 dex. This discrepancy is smaller compared to the results\nbased on other metallicity calibrations previously reported. However, we notice\nthat the direct method could not account for the variation in ionization\nparameters, indicating that the precise calibration of metallicity using the\ndirect method has yet to be fully realized. We report significant discrepancies\nbetween data and the photoionization model, which illustrates that the\none-dimensional photoionization model is incapable of representing the\ncomplexity of real situations."}

In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly\naffects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having\nstronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass\ndistribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback,\nparticularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We\ninvestigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since\nclusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback\ndependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields\nfewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff\ndensities of $10,\\ 10^{1.5},\\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf\ngalaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We\ncalculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe,\nstellar winds, and ionizing radiation.

Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts\nour hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to\nfeedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence,\nsuggesting its shape is set by gravity.

We find\nthat Ly$\\alpha$ photons do not preferentially escape through the\nlowest-column-density pathways, but instead traverse channels of substantial\noptical depth, leading to suppressed central flux and the absence of strongly\nbeamed escape. Subdividing channels has little impact, indicating that geometry\nand covering fraction are more important than porosity. Channels containing\nmoderate amounts of neutral hydrogen alter escape in characteristic ways,\nincluding the appearance of quadruple-peaked spectra, which can be captured by\na simple flux-channel relation.

This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour\nsearches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new\n``particle-mesh-particle'' interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh\nmethod for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first,\nquantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy,\nand momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink --\nare deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple\ncontributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then\ncommunicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer\nstates are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to\nenforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme\nin the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its\napplication to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion. We\ndemonstrate that the former scheme converges in the terminal radial momentum\nfrom multiple supernovae across varying spatial resolutions, while for the\nlatter simulations of accretion in several configurations show excellent\nagreement with analytic solutions.
