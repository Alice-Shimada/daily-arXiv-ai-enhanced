In this paper, we use high-resolution simulations of\ngalactic wind launching to calibrate the extent to which broad H$\\alpha$} wings\ncan be used to infer the properties of galactic outflows. For this purpose, we\nanalyse a series of high-resolution wind simulations from the QED suite\nspanning two orders of magnitude in star formation surface density\n($\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$). We show that the broad component of H$\\alpha$}\nemission correlates well with the wind mass flux at heights $\\sim1$ kpc above\nthe galactic plane, but that the correlation is poor at larger distances from\nthe plane, and that even at 1 kpc the relationship between mass flux and\nsurface brightness of broad H$\\alpha$} is significantly sub-linear. The\nsub-linear scaling suggests that the electron column density in the wind\nincreases systematically with outflow strength, and that the conventional\nassumption of constant electron density in the wind leads to a systematic\noverestimate of how steeply mass loading factors depend on\n$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$. We provide empirical scaling relations that observers\ncan apply to correct for this effect when converting H$\\alpha$} measurements to\nmass outflow rates. Finally, we use synthetic observations of the\ndensity-diagnostic $[\\mathrm{S_{II}}]\\,\\lambda\\lambda6716,6731$ doublet to show\nthat using this diagnostic only slightly improves estimates of wind outflow\nrates compared to the naive assumption of constant electron density, and\nperforms significantly worse than the empirical correlation we provide."}

In NGC 6860, a molecular outflow surrounding the bipolar\nemission of the [O III] ionized gas is observed extending up to $R_{out}$ ~ 560\npc from the nucleus. There is evidence of molecular inflows along the stellar\nbar, although an alternative scenario, involving a decoupled rotation in a\ncircumnuclear disk (CND) can also explain the observed kinematics. Mrk 915\nshows double-peak CO profiles along one of its spiral arms.

The CO in the CND is rotating while outflowing within\n$R_{out}$ ~ 3 kpc, with the disturbances possibly being caused by the passage\nof the ionized gas outflow. Overall, the mass inflow rates are larger than the\naccretion rate needed to produce the observed luminosities, suggesting that\nonly a fraction of the inflowing gas ends up feeding the central black holes.\nAlthough we found signatures of AGN feedback on the cold molecular phase, the\nmass outflow rates of ~ 0.09-3 M$_\\odot$/yr indicate an overall weak impact at\nthese AGN luminosities.

When the host galaxy redshift is known,\nfor example, through observation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, GW\ndetections can provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant,\n$H_0$. However, even in the absence of an EM counterpart, inferring $H_0$ is\npossible through the dark siren method. In this approach, every galaxy in the\nGW localization volume is considered a potential host that contributes to a\nmeasurement of $H_0$, with redshift information supplied by galaxy catalogs.\nUsing mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the effect of catalog incompleteness on\ndark siren measurements of $H_0$.

We explore a low-reheating scenario where DM\nproduction occurs during reheating, resulting in significant entropy dilution\nof the DPDM abundance. Both weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and\nfeebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) DM scenarios are explored, depending\non the dark gauge coupling strength.

All comments welcome", "summary": "Astrometric perturbations of lensed arcs behind galaxy clusters have been\nrecently suggested as promising probes of small-scale ($\\lesssim10^9\nM_{\\odot}$) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM)\nsubhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the\nsymmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the\nobserved images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average\nsubhalo mass fraction ($f_{\\rm sub}$) in clusters that takes advantage of this\ninduced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic\nmodel of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos\nwithin a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from\nthese subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock\ndata, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated $f_{\\rm\nsub}$ to within 68\\% CI in 73\\% of cases, regardless of the lens model,\nastrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining\npower of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs,\nideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we\napply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we\nconstrain the upper limit on $\\log f_{\\rm sub} < -3.40^{+1.06}_{-0.97}$, while\nfor AS1063 System 1 we constrain $\\log f_{\\rm sub} = -2.36^{+0.56}_{-0.89}$\n(both at 68\\% CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our\nmethod's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on\ndark matter properties in cluster environments."}
