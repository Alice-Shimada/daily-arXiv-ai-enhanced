In this approach, evaluating the derivatives of the partition function up to order $k$ increases the matrix-multiplication cost by a factor of $(k+1)(k+2)/2$ compared to computing the free energy alone, while the memory footprint is only $k$ times that of the original calculation. In the limit where the derivatives of the SVD are neglected, we establish a theoretical correspondence between our forward-mode AD and conventional impurity methods. Numerically, we find that the proposed AD algorithm can calculate internal energy and specific heat significantly higher accuracy than the impurity method at comparable computational cost. We also provide a practical procedure to extract critical exponents from derivatives of the renormalized tensor in TRG calculations in both two and three dimensions."}

The CASPER toolflow has been instrumental in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital instruments for various radio telescopes, enabling for real-time data processing and analysis. However, the current frontend tool that CASPER uses for high-level FPGA design is based on Model Composer integrated into MATLAB/Simulink, which is a proprietary software. In this paper, we introduce Scilab as a new frontend tool for the CASPER toolflow. Scilab is an open-source software platform for numerical computation and data visualization, which offers a similar environment to MATLAB/Simulink for designing CASPER blocks, generating FPGA Intellectual Property (IP) cores, and simulating Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. We present our implementation of Scilab in the CASPER toolflow and demonstrate its capabilities by developing an FPGA based spectrometer on a RFSoC4x2, a commonly used CASPER platform well suited to radio astronomy applications. We have also developed Scilab support for other CASPER compatible platforms. Our results show that Scilab can successfully be used as an alternate frontend for CASPER-based designs."}

This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate."}

This therefore complements the already publicly available NNPDF fitting code to enable fits with both neural network and fixed polynomial PDF parameterisations to be performed by the community, with otherwise identical theoretical and experimental inputs. As a first application, we use the new code to compare the PDFs found from fits at both NNLO and aN$^3$LO perturbative orders, but applying these two fitting approaches. We assess the impact of the two different methodologies on the PDFs and their uncertainties, providing results that complement previous comparisons between published PDF sets at NNLO and aN$^3$LO.

These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\\lesssim$ M$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim$\\,7\\,M$_\\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\\lesssim R^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim 24$\\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \\leq$ B$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}} \\leq 10^{16}$\\,G and beyond).

For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution."}

Traditionally, the Ellis \\& Baldwin expression,$\\mathcal{A}=2+x(1+α)$, has been widely adopted, assuming power-law number counts and a single power-law spectral energy distribution (SED). Realistic surveys, however, involve a range of non-ideal effects, including diverse SEDs, finite instrumental bandpasses, non-power-law number counts, multi-band photometry and photo-$z$ selections, and direction-dependent or stochastic detection limits. In this paper, we incorporate these effects explicitly at the theoretical level and present a unified formulation of the kinematic dipole for a general parent population and a general multi-dimensional selection function. We show that the dipole amplitude is not described by a single index, but is instead given by a functional, $\\mathcal{A}[\\mathcal{W},f]$, defined as the Doppler response of the selection function acting on the underlying population. We demonstrate that the classical Ellis--Baldwin result is recovered as a special limiting case of this formalism, and clarify the relation between the theoretical coefficient $\\mathcal{A}$ and the dipole vector estimated from finite catalogs, separating theoretical response from statistical uncertainty. This framework provides a basis for reinterpreting reported discrepancies in kinematic dipole measurements across surveys and is directly applicable to future wide-area, multi-band observations."}

There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind.

Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role.

Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision.

When this breaking occurs dynamically in the early Universe, stable domain wall networks are formed, which can eventually dominate the cosmic energy density. To avoid this problem, explicit $\\mathcal{Z}_2$-breaking terms in the scalar potential are usually introduced in an ad hoc manner. In this Letter, we show that if the same $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis."}

In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\\!+\\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.\n  We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds. While the post-quench geometry considered here is static and no electromagnetic field is included, the present work establishes a foundation for future investigations of particle creation in genuinely time-dependent curved spacetimes and in the presence of electromagnetic backgrounds."}

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics."}

These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$. In this Letter, we establish a novel multi-messenger framework and present a proof-of-principle concept of how the observations of BBH mergers form next-generation GW detectors can improve the inference of parameters generating the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal, and help break degeneracies between them."}

Solar-model metallicity systematics are made explicit by presenting results for both the B16--GS98 and B16--AGSS09met solar-model realizations.

However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $Ω_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $Ω_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology."}

It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer.

Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors.

Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \\gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$Δβ$ plane, where $Δβ$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions."}

Afterwards, the Relativistic Boltzmann Transport (RBT) model, which has been employed to obtain most part of the results of this thesis, is carefully described, from the numerical and physical perspectives. The study of attractors and universality proceeds then by starting from a simple one-dimensional massless model, moving to increasingly more complex scenarios, involving the full 3+1D setup, non-conformal systems and realistic event-by-event fluctuations. Particular attention is paid to the physical scales which govern the system collectivity and their interplay. We show that a very good description of collective behaviour can be carried out by means of a few variables which characterise the systems under study."}

A Study on Ionized and Warm Molecular Gas Outflows of 6 Type-2 AGNs", "comment": "21 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven gas outflows are one of the best tracers of AGN feedback in action, as these powerful outflows expel/heat or compress the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), thus quenching or enhancing star-forming activity in their hosts. Studying the kinematics of outflows in different gas phases is crucial for comprehending how AGNs impact the ISM within their host galaxies. However, the differences in the physical natures of ionized and warm molecular gas outflows remain largely unexplored. To obtain a complete picture of AGN outflows and their feedback effects, we present a study of both ionized and warm molecular gas outflows in six type-2 AGNs ($z<0.1$) that exhibit strong ionized outflows in previous optical observations. Utilizing the Triple Spectrograph and Double Spectrograph instruments on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, we conduct spatially resolved measurements in the slit direction of strong emission lines from both ionized and warm molecular gas, such as $\\rm [O\\ III]$, $\\rm Paα$, $\\rm H_{2}$ 1-0 S(1), etc., allowing for a direct comparison of their outflow properties. One out of six AGNs shows significant ionized and warm molecular outflows in near-infrared bands, exhibiting the most powerful kinematics and highest luminosity. A positive correlation between the kinematics and AGN luminosity is shown, suggesting that more luminous AGNs, which reflect higher levels of AGN activity, tend to have a greater impact on the gases, probably driving the outflows."}

In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $α$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons."}

However, because such observables depend on cumulative line-of-sight integrals over the Hubble rate, their sensitivity to time-dependent features of the dark energy equation of state is intrinsically limited. In this work, we examine this limitation from an information-based perspective using the eigenvalue structure of the Fisher information matrix constructed from distance, expansion rate, and growth observables. We show that distance and expansion-rate data generically produce a strongly hierarchical Fisher spectrum dominated by a single information mode, reflecting an irreducible loss of sensitivity to temporal variations in dark energy. This behavior can be traced directly to the integrated kernel structure of geometric observables. Growth measurements, by contrast, respond through differential dynamics and can introduce additional independent information directions. Using both controlled mock data and survey-like configurations representative of next-generation experiments, we find that the impact of growth information depends not only on its nominal precision but also on the structure of the data covariance. In simplified mock setups, growth measurements can partially activate a second information direction even at moderate precision. In Euclid-like configurations, however, the information remains effectively one-dimensional until growth precision reaches the percent level, below which a second mode emerges rapidly. These results clarify the complementary roles of distance and growth probes and provide a model-independent criterion for assessing the physical content of cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy."}

Most dark matter models have the dark matter consisting mainly of new-physics-matter such as WIMPs being supersymmetric partners of possibly known particles or, as in Maxim Khlopovs model, a doubly negatively charged new-physics-particle with a helium nucleus attached. But usually the new-physics matter makes up weight-wise the major content. It is only in our model that the ordinary matter content in the dark matter dominates. We here expose some weak phenomenological evidence that, in truth, dark matter should be of the type with a dominant component of ordinary matter (weight-wise), thus favoring as the typical example our previously so much studied vacuum type 2 model. The main such evidence is that we manage a fit to data in which the 3.5 keV X-rays, presumed to result from dark matter, come both from collisions of dark matter with dark matter and from dark matter with ordinary matter! Both mechanisms are of so similar an order of magnitude that they are both seen, indicating that their similarity is due to a significant similarity between dark with ordinary matter. The fact that the amounts of ordinary and dark matter only deviate by a factor 6 points in the same direction. Using the information obtained from this fitting, we develop our speculation that the main content weight-wise of dark matter is ordinary matter to the very DAMA experiment. Actually we found three spots on the sky in which we fit the observed production of 3.5 keV X-rays with ordinary plus dark scattering."}

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing."}

Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox."}

We examine specifically an approximation to the \"linearly exact\" gradients (aLE) with standard SPH kernel gradients and with linearly reproducing kernels (RPKs) that fulfill the lowest order consistency relations exactly by construction. Most of the explored SPH formulations use shock dissipation (i.e. artificial viscosity and conductivity) with slope-limited reconstruction and parameters that trigger on both shocks and noise. We also compare with a recent particle hydrodynamics formulation that uses both RPKs and Roe's approximate Riemann solver instead of shock dissipation. Not too surprisingly, we find that the shock tests are rather insensitive to the gradient accuracy, but whenever instabilities are involved the gradient accuracy plays a crucial role. The reproducing kernel gradients perform best, but they are closely followed by the much simpler aLE gradients. The Riemann solver approach has some (minor) advantages in the shock tests, but shows some resistance against instability growth and at low resolution the corresponding Kelvin-Helmholtz simulations show substantially slower instability growth than the best shock dissipation approaches. Based on the battery of benchmark tests performed here, we consider a shock dissipation approach with reproducing kernels (our versions $V_3$ and $V_5$) as best, but closely followed by a similar version ($V_2$) that uses the simpler and computationally cheaper aLE gradients."}

Our results demonstrate that Kosmulator reproduces Cobaya's posterior constraints to within $\\leq0.3σ$ statistical agreement on $H_{0}$ and $Ω_{m}$ and $<0.6\\%$ precision on $χ^{2}$, while achieving a $\\sim 4.5\\times$ reduction in wall-clock time on a single CPU core compared to a standard MPI-parallelised baseline. Furthermore, we showcase the framework's utility by constraining the implicit power-law $f(Q)$ \"$f_1$CDM\" model and demonstrating its automated model selection capabilities (AIC/BIC). Kosmulator is introduced as a \"scientific sieve\" for rapid hypothesis testing, allowing researchers to efficiently filter theoretical candidates before deploying high-precision resources."}

It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect.

This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer.

This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively.

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$).

Neutrino oscillations are characterized by a set of parameters inferred from experiments conducted in different production and detection environments. The two solar oscillation parameters, $Δm^2_{21}$ and $θ_{12}$, can be estimated using both solar neutrino experiments and reactor neutrino experiments. In reactor experiments, neutrinos are detected after coherent vacuum evolution, while solar neutrinos arrive at the detector as incoherent mixtures. In this work, we use Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to quantify and compare the information content accessible in these two experimental setups. We find that for reactor neutrinos, flavor measurements saturate the QFI bound for both parameters over specific energy ranges, demonstrating their optimality and explaining the high precision achieved by these experiments. In contrast, for solar neutrinos the phase-based contribution to the QFI, originating from the quantum coherence, is absent, rendering the estimation of $Δm_{21}^2$ purely population-based and effectively classical, while the QFI for $θ_{12}$ is dominated by basis rotation at high energies and is nearly saturated by flavor measurements. Consequently, solar neutrino experiments are intrinsically more sensitive to $θ_{12}$ than to $Δm_{21}^2$. This analysis highlights a fundamental distinction between the two estimation problems and accounts for their differing achievable precisions."}

In this Letter, we show that if the same $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis."}

Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families).

We then demonstrate that for high-energy neutrinos, the interplay between anisotropic LIV operators and the Earth's matter potential produces, distinct, observable signatures absent in the vacuum case. We identify a crossover regime where the energy-dependent LIV Hamiltonian becomes comparable to the matter potential, leading to strong interference effects. By analyzing the propagation of neutrinos through a realistic Earth model, we establish three key phenomenological consequences: (1) direction-dependent resonant enhancements of oscillation probabilities, (2) a macroscopic breakdown of neutrino-antineutrino symmetry for CPT-even operators, and (3) a significant increase of the $ν_τ$ flux due to LIV-driven injection of high-energy neutrinos into the $τ$ regeneration cycle.

Moreover, the shadow boundaries and the photon rings do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence. The abrupt changes in redshift factor and the truncated photon regions profoundly influence the image, producing distinctive features such as the step-like structures.

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing."}

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach.

Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics."}

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin."}

However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies.

Our results show that mass accretion via TDEs peaks within the first 2 Myr and decreases more rapidly for higher initial SMBH masses, with roughly half the disrupted stellar debris being accreted. Compact object accretion is confined mostly to orbits with pericenters between 4 and 27 Schwarzschild radii and is suppressed by an order of magnitude when inspiral criteria are applied."}

When this breaking occurs dynamically in the early Universe, stable domain wall networks are formed, which can eventually dominate the cosmic energy density. To avoid this problem, explicit $\\mathcal{Z}_2$-breaking terms in the scalar potential are usually introduced in an ad hoc manner. In this Letter, we show that if the same $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis."}

Building on the scaling law $\\mathcal{M} \\propto ε^2$ and the characteristic mismatch profile with respect to $L_c$, we propose a geometric selection rule for observability: a detectable signal imposes a strict dual constraint requiring both macroscopic spatial coherence ($L_c \\sim M$) and classical-level intensity ($ε\\gtrsim 10^{-4}$). This criterion quantitatively rules out the observability of incoherent, high-entropy quantum foam, suggesting that any significant ringdown deviation would serve as definitive evidence for macroscopically coherent horizon structures."}

In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $α$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons."}

The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter."}

The model admits six free parameters in the decoupling limit: three masses and three dimensionless parameters. Depending on the mass hierarchies between dark matter particles with half of the new Higgs mass, the DM relic density will be determined by different channels, where $χ$ and $S$ production can be generated individually. We numerically study the relic density as a function of the model's free parameters and determine the regions consistent with the dark matter constraint for four possible cases.

Beyond Second Order Perturbations", "comment": "44 p, no figures", "summary": "Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon.\n  In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage."}

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG.

Utilizing the derived dielectric functions, we then calculate the collisional energy loss for a heavy quark using two established formalisms: the plasma physics-based Thoma-Gyulassy formula and the thermal field theory-originated Kirzhnits-Thoma formula. Our results show that for both formalisms, the collisional energy loss increases with the nonextensive parameter $q$ with this enhancement being more significant at higher incident quark momenta and suppressed for a heavier quark mass. The energy loss predicted from the Kirzhnits-Thoma formula is substantially larger than that from the Thoma-Gyulassy formula, and the nonextensive effect on the energy loss is more pronounced in the former. Furthermore, the mass suppression of the nonextensive effect on the energy loss is weaker in the Kirzhnits-Thoma approach.

Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement\" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions."}

We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium."}

We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature.

However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $Ω_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $Ω_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology."}

The neutral spin-zero Higgs bosons (scalar or pseudoscalar) mediating dark matter interaction, can also produce some effects at low energies which modify the SM predictions significantly.

In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries."}

However, the extent to which this approximation reliably captures the true features of such systems remains an open question. In this work, we adopt the results obtained with the Gaussian expansion method as a benchmark to assess the validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in hadronic systems. We also investigate the dependence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation results on the choice of trial wave functions. A comprehensive study of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is carried out by performing calculations using Slater-type functions and Gaussian-type functions as trial wave functions, and by comparing the resulting predictions with those obtained from the Gaussian expansion method. We find that the calculations performed within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation are close to those obtained with the Gaussian expansion method when the heavy-quark mass is relatively small. However, as the heavy-quark mass increases, calculations employing Slater-type functions yield larger values than those from the Gaussian expansion method, whereas those using Gaussian-type functions lead to smaller ones. The use of Slater-type functions generally leads to an enhanced binding energy. The underestimation observed in Born-Oppenheimer approximation calculations with Gaussian-type functions primarily stems from the neglect of non-adiabatic corrections. This comparative study provides deeper insight into the structure of doubly heavy hadrons and clarifies the applicability and limitations of the Born-Oppenheimer treatment in these systems."}

We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries."}

The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $δN$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce.

These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\\lesssim$ M$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim$\\,7\\,M$_\\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\\lesssim R^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim 24$\\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \\leq$ B$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}} \\leq 10^{16}$\\,G and beyond).

The power of the Grassmannian approach is especially evident for four-point functions, which require dynamical input beyond kinematics.

These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$.

In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $α$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons."}

Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $ρ_{\\rm DE}<0$ at higher redshift to $ρ_{\\rm DE}>0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\\dagger$ by $ρ_{\\rm DE}(z_\\dagger)=0$. A single canonical scalar cannot realize such a smooth evolution during expansion, whereas a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework can accommodate the required behavior; in particular, the two-field system permits smooth phantom-divide crossings at finite $ρ_{\\rm DE}>0$ and distinguishes them from the separate notion of a density zero crossing.

The present-day equation of state remains close to a cosmological constant: combinations including supernovae give $w_0\\simeq -1$, while combinations without supernovae but with an external $H_0$ prior show only a mild preference for $w_0<-1$ at the $\\sim1.5$--$1.7σ$ level."}
