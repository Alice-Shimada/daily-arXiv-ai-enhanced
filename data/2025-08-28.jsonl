We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust\nparticles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for\nthe chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding\nenergies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S,\nCa, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies,\nand Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the\nbinding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local\nminima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found\nfor each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8\neV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe\n(6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding\nenergies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a\nlog-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have\nlarge binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust\nparticles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N,\nO, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding\nenergies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated\nwith dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM),\nsuggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We\nestimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to\n3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime.

Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the\nTNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred\nfrom present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to\nquantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of\nmigration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces\nartificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably,\nabout 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that\nthese populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects\nappear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and\nin 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths\nSFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by\ndispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these\ndistortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history:\nstrong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and\n150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average\nouter-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk\nbiases up to 125%.

Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent\nspectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in\nthe formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of\n$10^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and only old stellar\npopulations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed\nbefore and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \\sim 3-4$.\nThe simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the\nstellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the\nluminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies,\nradiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and\nreducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core\nsizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\\sim$ 1 kpc) more\nconsistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$,\nin good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or\nSN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In\ncontrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines\nsharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution,\nbut their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative\nfeedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the\nreduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the\nstellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of\nCIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect."}

A growing body of research has\nfocused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of\nDM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly\nalter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal\ndeformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during\nbinary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that,\nfor the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using\nreal GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115,\nand GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\\chi}$, and\nparticle mass, $m_{\\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a\nscalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on\n$F_{\\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating\nthat different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in\ndifferent ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM\nhalo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105\nand GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding\nstrong upper bounds on $F_{\\chi}$.

Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and\nanalyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC\n2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected\nbased on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We\nutilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering\nof Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\nalong with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and\nastrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including\nradial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the\ntangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect\nthem. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with\nreal data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to\nstudy their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We\nalso applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the\nclusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five\nclusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing\nsignificantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100\npc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The\nluminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally\nconsistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was\nfound to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67\nand NGC 2281 for the first time."}

We leverage CALIFA integral-field spectroscopy to\nsimulate fiber-fed observations at redshifts z=0.005-0.4, accounting for seeing\neffects. We analyze systematic aperture correction trends across galaxy\nmorphologies and derive correction recipes based on: fiber-measured indices,\nglobal g-r color, absolute r-band magnitude Mr, and physical half-light radius\nR50. Corrections for absorption indices typically reach >~15% of their\ndynamical range at z~0.02, decreasing to ~7% at z~0.1 (median SDSS redshift)\nand becoming negligible above z~0.2. Spiral galaxies exhibit the largest\naperture effects due to their strong internal gradients. Our correction\nrecipes, applied to the SDSS-DR7 dataset, significantly reduce scatter in\nstellar population diagnostic planes and enhance bimodality in age-sensitive\ndiagrams.

The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the\nquantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at\nall orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be\nderived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences\ndescribe ${\\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of\nSeiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity\nsolutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made.

Using multi-timescale methods, previous work\nhas shown that the precession and nutation dynamics in such systems can be\nclassified into so-called spin morphologies --mutually exclusive regions that\npartition the configuration space and characterize the motion of the black-hole\nspins relative to the binary's angular momentum. Radiation reaction can induce\nsecular transitions between different morphology classes, which are generic\noccurrences during the inspiral of black-hole binaries. In this contribution,\nwe systematically explore a more restrictive class of solutions in which\nmultiple morphological transitions occur concurrently, i.e., within the same\nprecession cycle. We find that all such cases can be mapped and characterized\nanalytically, and we confirm these findings through numerical integrations.\nThese coincident transitions correspond to extreme spin configurations in\nblack-hole binaries with potential observational signatures in\ngravitational-wave astronomy."}

A growing body of research has\nfocused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of\nDM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly\nalter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal\ndeformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during\nbinary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that,\nfor the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using\nreal GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115,\nand GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\\chi}$, and\nparticle mass, $m_{\\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a\nscalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on\n$F_{\\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating\nthat different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in\ndifferent ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM\nhalo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105\nand GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding\nstrong upper bounds on $F_{\\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale\n$m_{\\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to\nprobing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations."}

The\nmost stringent upper limits are at $800~\\textrm{Hz}$ with $h_{0} =\n1.32\\times10^{-25}$, at the $90\\%$ confidence level. Searching in the high\nfrequency bands allows us to probe astrophysically interesting ellipticities\nwith our results excluding isolated neutron stars rotating faster than\n$2.5~\\textrm{ms}$ with ellipticities $\\epsilon \\geq 1.96 \\times\n10^{-8}\\left[\\frac{d}{100~\\textrm{pc}}\\right]$ within a distance $d$ from\nEarth. Our results also exclude r-mode amplitudes $\\alpha \\geq 7 \\times\n10^{-7}\\left[\\frac{d}{100~\\textrm{pc}}\\right]$ for neutron stars stars spinning\nfaster than 400 Hz."}

Crucial in the connection relations is\nthe phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular\nsingularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the\nquantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at\nall orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be\nderived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences\ndescribe ${\\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of\nSeiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity\nsolutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very\nencouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge\nperiod, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function. Actually, the\nprocedure can be considered an alternative to instanton computations. On the\ngravity side, results for the wave functions are at leading order compatible\nwith analogous expressions found by studying the Teukolsky (or others, like\nRegge-Wheeler) equation. Besides, the whole construction can represent an\nuseful approach to these equations at all orders, shedding also light on\nnon-perturbative contributions, which should reveal very interesting for the\nconsequences in gravity perturbations."}

RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant,\nwhich in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci\ntensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to\nfind constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots\nhave been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and\njoint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for\nthe constrained model and compared with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model to\nverify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we\nhave also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational\nHubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive\npower through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different\ngraphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented\nto understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement\nbetween the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the\ntheoretical RCHDE model, and observational data."}
