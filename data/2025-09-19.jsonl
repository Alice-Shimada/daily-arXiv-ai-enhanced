Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the\ntwo-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the\ndamped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in\nKrylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature\nlimit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and\nreproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is\nsuppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is\nsuppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory\ndynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features. However,\nKrylov complexity appears insensitive to the onset of decoherence, as no clear\ndistinctive signature is observed. We attribute this to the fact that Krylov\ncomplexity is defined in the Krylov basis, which does not coincide with the\nconventional basis typically used to study decoherence."}

Detailed 1-mm\nspectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and ALMA resolve the individual images and\nshow that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have\nsimilar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical\nredshifts. The HST F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four\ngalaxies with a photometric redshift zphot~1.0. Lens models that only include\nthe four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By\nadding a fifth massive component, lying south-east of the brightest galaxy of\nthe group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape\nand orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is\ndetected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter\nhalo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an\ninfrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on. The serendipitous\ndiscovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for\nexploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic\nevolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated\nwith the lensing galaxy group."}

This framework\ngives rise to regions of parameter space where DM is obtained via\nco-annihilation with nearby higgsino-like electroweakinos and DM direct\ndetection~signals are suppressed, the so-called ``blind spots\". On the other\nhand, collider signatures remain promising due to enhanced radiative decay\nmodes of higgsinos into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, rather than\ninto leptons or hadrons. This motivates searches for radiatively decaying\nneutralinos, however, these signals face substantial background challenges, as\nthe decay products are typically soft due to the small mass-splits ($\\Delta m$)\nbetween the LSP and the higgsino-like coannihilation partners. We apply a\ndata-driven Machine Learning (ML) analysis that improves sensitivity to these\nsubtle signals, offering a powerful complement to traditional search strategies\nto discover a new physics scenario. Using an LHC integrated luminosity of\n$100~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $14~\\mathrm{TeV}$, the method achieves a $5\\sigma$\ndiscovery reach for higgsino masses up to $225~\\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\\Delta\nm\\!\\lesssim\\!12~\\mathrm{GeV}$, and a $2\\sigma$ exclusion up to\n$285~\\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\\Delta m\\!\\lesssim\\!20~\\mathrm{GeV}$. These results\nhighlight the power of collider searches to probe DM candidates that remain\nhidden from current direct detection experiments, and provide a motivation for\na search by the LHC collaborations using ML methods."}

The innumerable folds of this\nsheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system\nscales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark\nmatter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if\ndark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case\nfor axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark\nmatter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most\ndirect detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the\ncase. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of\nfine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the\ndetectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable\nin haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the\naxion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This\nconclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by\nhaloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the\nQCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the\nrequired level under the Standard Halo Model assumption."}
