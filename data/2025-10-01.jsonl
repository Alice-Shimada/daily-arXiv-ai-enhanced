We\npresent a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western\nGalactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA\nAll-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a\nstatistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The\nbest-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms\ndescribing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around\nr200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding\nto a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to\nr200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the\nassumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the\nbaryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas\ndistribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo\ncenter to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas\nprofiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic\nfilaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction\nexceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed\ntransition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that\nr200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments\nconnect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density\nprofile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG\nsimulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more\nefficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii."}

We show that the CFT\ncan only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS\nsatisfies a certain criterion.

Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR\nmodes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the\narea parameter $\\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value\n$\\xi_{max} \\approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of\nnon-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary.\nAssuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one\nrecognizes $\\xi \\approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally\nsuppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the\nscaling regime.

Our algorithm stacks low SNR\ndetection catalogs instead of pixels, the sparsity of which enables\napproximations that reduce the number of stacks required. Our algorithm\nachieves real-world speedups of $10$--$10^3 \\times$ over image-based\nshift-and-stack while retaining the ability to find faint objects. We validate\nits performance by recovering synthetic inner and outer solar system objects\ninjected into images from the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP).\nExploring the sensitivity--compute time trade-off of this algorithm, we find\nthat our method achieves a speedup of $\\sim30\\times$ with $88\\%$ of the memory\nusage while sacrificing $0.25$ mag in depth compared to image-based\nshift-and-stack. These speedups enable the broad application of shift-and-stack\nto large-scale imaging surveys and searches for faint inner solar system\nobjects.

Instead of relying on\nthe phenomenological parametrisation commonly used to capture curvature effects\nat the largest scales, we present a case study based on closed quadratic\ninflation, where the primordial spectrum is derived in full generality and in a\ngauge-invariant manner. Within this framework, we analyze both the\n$\\texttt{plik}$ PR3 and $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 Planck CMB likelihoods and find\nthat the constraints on $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}$ shift towards spatial flatness.\nIn $\\texttt{plik}$ the preference for $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}<0$ decreases from\n$\\gtrsim 3.5\\sigma$ to $\\sim 2.5\\sigma$, while in $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ it reduces\nto $\\sim 2\\sigma$. At large angular scales ($\\ell < 10$), our model explains\nthe low-$\\ell$ power suppression anomaly, notably improving the fit to the\nquadrupole. However, the reduced preference for highly negative values of\n$\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}$ only partially accounts for the lensing anomaly at high\nmultipoles, worsening the fit to the $\\texttt{plik}$ spectrum at small scales.\nBy contrast, in the $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 spectrum, where the lensing anomaly\nis less pronounced, the model yields an overall improvement. Our analysis\nhighlights a key conceptual point: closed-inflation models tie the curvature\nparameter to the inflationary dynamics and the primordial spectrum, enforcing\nconsistency conditions that do not necessarily allow for the large deviations\nfrom flatness seen in phenomenological parametrisations. In the case of\nquadratic inflation, these restrictions reduce the apparent evidence for\nnegative curvature reported by earlier analyses, while allowing for a mildly\nclosed geometry."}

However, in addition to the main deflector\nthat produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the\nline-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak\nlensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on\narcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS\neffects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more\nstraightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more\nrealistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally\ncheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique,\nwhich is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale,\nextending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale.\nWe focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1.\nIn addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a\nregion approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers,\ninducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These\nfluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone,\nnecessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3.

Sub-micro-arcsecond\nastrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light\npropagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is\nindispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the\npost-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some\nsolar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light\nsource as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the\ngravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value\nproblem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by\nthe spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past\ninfinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical\nrelativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the\ndetermination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the\nspatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several\nbasic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one\nto calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar\nsystem bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for\nstellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system.\nNumerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole\nand quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the\ngiant planets.

The Hector instrument employs 21 optical fibre bundles feeding\ninto two double-beam spectrographs to enable wide-field multi-object IFS\nobservations of galaxies. To efficiently process the survey data, we adopt the\ndata reduction pipeline developed for the SAMI Galaxy Survey, with significant\nupdates to accommodate Hector's dual-spectrograph system. These enhancements\naddress key differences in spectral resolution and other instrumental\ncharacteristics relative to SAMI, and are specifically optimised for Hector's\nunique configuration. We introduce a two-dimensional arc fitting approach that\nreduces the RMS velocity scatter by a factor of 1.2--3.4 compared to fitting\narc lines independently for each fibre. The pipeline also incorporates detailed\nmodelling of chromatic optical distortion in the wide-field corrector, to\naccount for wavelength-dependent spatial shifts across the focal plane. We\nassess data quality through a series of validation tests, including wavelength\nsolution accuracy, spectral resolution, throughput characterisation,\nastrometric precision, sky subtraction residuals, and flux calibration\nstability (4\\% systematic offset when compared to Legacy Survey fluxes). We\ndemonstrate that Hector delivers high-fidelity, science-ready datasets,\nsupporting robust measurements of galaxy kinematics, stellar populations, and\nemission-line properties, and provide examples. Additionally, we address\nsystematic uncertainties identified during the data processing and propose\nfuture improvements to enhance the precision and reliability of upcoming data\nreleases.

For DM with\nmasses below a few GeV, however, evaporation caused by collisions with hot\nnuclei efficiently ejects particles, preventing their long-term accumulation.\nThis defines a minimum mass threshold, typically around a few GeV, below which\nthe Sun cannot retain DM. In this work, we investigate how an additional\nevaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically\nthick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this\nequilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a\nphase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming\na Maxwellian form. Without a barrier, we recover the standard result that\nevaporation dominates for sub-few-GeV DM, leading to negligible net retention.\nWith a barrier, however, the escape of light DM is strongly suppressed,\nenabling the Sun to capture and retain particles below the canonical\nevaporation mass. The barrier effectively raises the escape threshold, either\nthrough repeated scatterings or through an additional long-range attractive\npotential. We present the resulting phase-space distributions, density and\nvelocity profiles, and highlight how the suppression of the high-velocity tail\ndrives the captured population closer to thermal equilibrium with the solar\ncore.

In this work, we use this new\nmodel to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical\nmechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were\nsub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past.\nThe stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre\nflux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be\nindependent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve\ninto MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors\nlies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger\nthat triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting\ntheir cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents\nfurther gas cooling, resulting in quenching.

Recent findings present in the\nliterature indicate that the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a\nbetter fit to Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data for $z_\\dagger < 2.3$, but also\naccommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter\ndistance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We\npresent a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the\nPantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\n(DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible\n$3.9\\sigma$ deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance\nof exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores\nthe potential of $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological\ntensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in\nreshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature\nof dark energy."}

We show that a similar formula holds\nfor the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers\nand the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a\ncrucial role in the helicity change.\n  The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we\ndiscuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the\nchiral anomaly in the early universe."}

Instead of relying on\nthe phenomenological parametrisation commonly used to capture curvature effects\nat the largest scales, we present a case study based on closed quadratic\ninflation, where the primordial spectrum is derived in full generality and in a\ngauge-invariant manner. Within this framework, we analyze both the\n$\\texttt{plik}$ PR3 and $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 Planck CMB likelihoods and find\nthat the constraints on $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}$ shift towards spatial flatness.\nIn $\\texttt{plik}$ the preference for $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}<0$ decreases from\n$\\gtrsim 3.5\\sigma$ to $\\sim 2.5\\sigma$, while in $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ it reduces\nto $\\sim 2\\sigma$. At large angular scales ($\\ell < 10$), our model explains\nthe low-$\\ell$ power suppression anomaly, notably improving the fit to the\nquadrupole. However, the reduced preference for highly negative values of\n$\\Omega_{\\mathcal{K}}$ only partially accounts for the lensing anomaly at high\nmultipoles, worsening the fit to the $\\texttt{plik}$ spectrum at small scales.\nBy contrast, in the $\\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 spectrum, where the lensing anomaly\nis less pronounced, the model yields an overall improvement. Our analysis\nhighlights a key conceptual point: closed-inflation models tie the curvature\nparameter to the inflationary dynamics and the primordial spectrum, enforcing\nconsistency conditions that do not necessarily allow for the large deviations\nfrom flatness seen in phenomenological parametrisations. In the case of\nquadratic inflation, these restrictions reduce the apparent evidence for\nnegative curvature reported by earlier analyses, while allowing for a mildly\nclosed geometry."}

The scalar field parameter $\\alpha$, which governs dark energy\ndynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone.\nFor the full dataset, we obtain $\\alpha = 0.055 \\pm 0.041$ in the $\\phi$CDM\nmodel and $\\alpha = 0.095 \\pm 0.056$ in the $\\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly\nfavoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\\sigma$ and\n$1.7\\sigma$.
