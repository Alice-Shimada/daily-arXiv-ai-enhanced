Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "The mildly non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation holds much of the\ninformation that upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to exploit, making\nfast and accurate predictions on these scales essential. We present the\n$N$-body module of DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done\nwith Jax), designed to deliver high-fidelity, GPU-accelerated, and\ndifferentiable particle-mesh simulations tailored for cosmological inference.\nTheory-informed time integrators such as the recently introduced BullFrog\nmethod allow for accurate predictions already with few time steps (e.g. $6$\nsteps for per-cent-level accuracy in terms of the present-day power spectrum at\n$k \\approx 0.2 \\, h / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ using $N = 512^3$ particles, which takes\njust a few seconds). To control discreteness effects and achieve high accuracy,\nthe code incorporates a suite of advanced techniques, for example a custom\nnon-uniform FFT implementation for force evaluation. Both forward- and\nreverse-mode differentiation are supported, with memory requirements\nindependent of the number of time steps; in the reverse case, this is achieved\nthrough an adjoint formulation. We extensively study the effect of various\nnumerical parameters on the accuracy. As an application of DISCO-DJ, we perform\nfield-level inference by recovering $\\sigma_8$ and the initial conditions from\na noisy Gadget matter density field. Coupled with our recently introduced\nEinstein--Boltzmann solver, the DISCO-DJ ecosystem provides a self-consistent,\nfully differentiable pipeline for modelling the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse.

The gravitational waveforms emitted\nby EMRIs are highly sensitive to the orbital dynamics of the small compact\nobject, which in turn are determined by the geometry of the underlying\nspacetime. In this paper, we explore the de- tectability of regular black holes\nwith sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions\nof the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by ana- lyzing the\nmetric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating\nthe marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for\ntimelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum,\nand energy significantly depend on the model parameter {\\alpha} for both\norbits. Our main aim is to focus on the influence of the model parameter on a\nspecific kind of orbit, the periodic orbit, surrounding a supermassive RSBH.\nThe findings show that, for a constant rational integer, {\\alpha} has a\nsignificant impact on the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit.\nUtilising the numerical kludge method, we further investigate the gravitational\nwaveforms of the small celestial body over various periodic orbits. The\nwaveforms display discrete zoom and spin phases within a complete orbital\nperiod, influenced by the RSBH parameter {\\alpha}. As the system evolves, the\nphase shift in the gravitational waveforms grows progressively more pronounced,\nwith cumulative deviations amplifying over time. With the ongoing advancements\nin space- based gravitational wave detection systems, our results will aid in\nleveraging EMRIs to probe and characterize the RSBH properties."}

AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of\nmaterial through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that\ninfluence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus\nGalaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms\nresponsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this\nSeyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We\nanalysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of\nthe Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced\ndust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied\nthe morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the\nCircinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect\ndirectly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures\nand argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the\nmechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of\n0.3-7.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material\nis expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The\ninferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability\nin AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales,\nthe ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow\nis stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than\nin the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or\ncollimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its\ngeometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism."}

The approach models the spacetime (and extra fields) as a\nstationary, axisymmetric deformation of the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist-like\ncoordinates, expands metric deformations as a spectral series in radius and\npolar angle, and converts the resulting beyond-Einstein field equations into\nalgebraic equations for the spectral coefficients.

Physical\nproperties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important\nelements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the\nphysical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission\nprocesses. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical\nanalysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as\nwell as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the\nsubset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical\ndata, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive\nliterature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for\nuncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain\ndistributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs\nand regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their\nage and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for\nthe entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal\ndistribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within\nindividual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity\nshow larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of\nthe ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their\nimpact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and\ndensity on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows\ngood agreement."}

It is now possible to directly\nmeasure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky\n$\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a\nvaluable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by\ngiving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not\nmeasurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a\nmodel-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is\nessential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift\nmeasurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the\ngeneral relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate\nthe position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different\nobservers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation\ntheory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the\ntransverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our\nnon-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra\nfor the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare\nthe former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is\nsuppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on\nnon-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities\ninduce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of\nboth the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient\nfor a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot\nexplain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the\nliterature."}

Furthermore, exploiting the inherent conformal symmetry\nof the theory, we take advantage of the natural enlargement of the exact\nsolutions to motivate the construction of a regular spacetime via conformal\nrescaling of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, we ensure the\nspacetime completeness by investigating the regularity of the curvature\ninvariants and the geodesic completeness of conformally/non-conformally coupled\nmassive and massless particles. We also study the global causal structure by\nexplicitly constructing the Penrose diagram of the regular spacetime.\nFurthermore, as a result of the spacetime completeness analysis, we generalize\nthe range of conformal factors that generate regular spacetimes, by considering\nthe $N$ parameter of the conformal factor as a real parameter with a lower\nbound, and not only a positive integer, as constrained in previous studies on\nregular Schwarzschild/Kerr black holes.

Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows\ncarrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these\nradial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five\ndifferent parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$,\nof the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models\npredict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer\ndisk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because\nradial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it\nelsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the\ninner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational\nconstraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity\n($\\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations\n($\\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \\textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows\ncannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our\nmodels reproduce this result at $R\\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is\nrelatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\\approx-1$ km/s. In\nagreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower\nmetallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models.\nExploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative\nrates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that\nestablish the ISM metallicity at low redshift.

The SIDM model leads to a 25%\nreduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass\nradius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar\ndistribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star\nclusters form at late times.

In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected\nHiggs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar\nfield theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate\nradiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\\bf A_I}$ and\nderive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in\nthe Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections\nnaturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar\nratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq\n0.9743$ and $r \\simeq 5.4\\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest\nACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \\textit{Planck}~2018\nlimit $r < 0.036$.

These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion\nphysics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and\ncore radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe\nstructures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates\ninferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically\noverestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly\nexplored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with\nspatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their\n\\textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\\lambda$) using both the common\nmethodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach\nthat treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion\nphases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates\nthe $\\lambda$ by a factor of $\\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode\nclassification in approximately $11\\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to\ncorrelate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a\ntransition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification\nin unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining\naccretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN\nunification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between\naccretion disk physics and optical spectral properties."}

Through the SOFIA Legacy program\nFIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that\ntheir B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire\nspine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are\nmore likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not\nubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of\nidentified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the\nbones and found them to be ~30-150 $\\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally\nlow virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity,\nsuggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse.\nMoreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation.

We find that CRs\nsimultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass\nfunction, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible\nwith observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star\ncluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity\ndispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately,\nthe primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae,\nand consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed\nin a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more\nbound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs.\nThrough this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback\nmodel, despite this idealized setup."}
