D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for inference of gravitational-wave time series, which relies on an Inception-inspired multi-scale convolutional feature extractor combined with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations. Cross-approximant transfer demonstrates comparable performance, achieving up to $44\\%$ reductions in mean absolute error across all parameters and up to $15\\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding 0.9 for mass parameters at signal-to-noise ratio 10, compared to 0.74 - 0.87 when training from scratch. Notably, GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms. The final regression head of the model can be adapted for a range of downstream tasks after pretraining, positioning it as a step towards foundation-style models in gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy."}

Building upon the formalism for GW-induced shear distortions, we develop a signal-to-noise framework that incorporates realistic survey characteristics, including cadence, angular resolution, and depth. We model the effective galaxy population using a redshift- and luminosity-dependent distribution to evaluate the noise power spectral density across the survey. Applying this framework to both LSST-like and idealized survey configurations, we derive characteristic strain sensitivity curves and identify the detectable parameter space for SMBHBs. We find that while current surveys are limited by angular resolution, an ideal full-sky survey with milliarcsecond-level precision and rapid cadence could detect continuous GW signals from SMBHBs at cosmological distances and partially bridge the PTA-LISA sensitivity gap. Our analysis highlights the potential and limitations of weak-lensing surveys for low-frequency GW astronomy, with angular resolution emerging as the dominant constraint."}

We compare this phenomenological framework to experimental data from the STAR Collaboration on azimuthal correlations in forward di-pion production in both proton-proton and proton-gold collisions.

Although highly powerful, the main limitation of AdS/CFT is that AdS does not appear in the real world outside of very specific limits. This limitation justifies the attempt to generalize the holographic principle to other spacetimes. In this thesis, we will pursue this direction and seek spacetimes that have at least some connection to de Sitter (dS), whose cosmological interest is evident. dS is, in fact, not only the geometry that best represents our Universe on large scales in the present, but also during the inflationary epoch that followed the Big Bang, where our current description of Nature fails completely.\n  First, we will present some basic facts about the AdS/CFT correspondence. Then, the gravitational path integral will be introduced. After presenting the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and dilaton-gravity models, a holographic link between the two will be established. Next, we will discuss the double-scaled limit of SYK, known as DSSYK. We will then consider a ``charged'' variation of SYK with Dirac fermions, for which we will determine the fermionic two-point function. After studying the thermodynamic properties of the gravitational dual of DSSYK and the quasinormal modes of massive real scalars propagating in this geometry, we will conjecture how to modify the duality when considering the Dirac version of the model, showing that several bounds constrain the space of possible dual theories. Finally, we will summarize our findings and present an outlook on possible future developments based on the results described here."}

A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets.

In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(φ)=m^{2}φ^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor.

These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift."}

For identical quantum numbers, the frequency expression and the degree of degeneracy are the same for all massless spin particles, regardless of their specific properties.

In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $ξφ^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe."}

Conversely, configurations with opposite signs ($M_1/M_2 < 0$) remain broadly viable, as destructive interference in the neutralino-Higgs coupling efficiently suppresses the spin-independent cross section. Finally, we delineate the remaining viable parameter space for both the opposite-sign cases and the specific configurations with negative $M_1$ and $M_2$."}

To address this bottleneck, we introduce a Dual-Channel Lensing feature extraction eXtended Long Short-Term Memory Network (DCL-xLSTM).

Crucially, this imaginary term is precisely responsible for generating the correct asymptotic decay of the wave function. From this framework, a unified analytical expression for the differential cross section is derived, applicable to all particle types considered. Given the successful fabrication of a Schwarzschild-equivalent medium via transformation optics, our theoretical scattering predictions can be tested experimentally by transmitting plane electromagnetic waves through such a structure.

While a bright siren -- a GW event with an identified electromagnetic (EM) counterpart -- provided the first such constraint, most detections, currently dominated by black hole mergers, lack EM signatures. A measurement of H0 is still possible with these dark sirens by statistically associating GW events with galaxies in existing catalogs based on the sky localization. In this work, we explore the potential of two subsets of sirens: rare golden dark sirens, for which a single galaxy dominates the H0 posterior, and silver dark sirens, which are far more common but have a larger set of plausible host galaxies. Using the fifth internal data release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we assess the suitability of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for spectroscopic follow-up of dark sirens. VIRUS exposures of the standard HETDEX depth provide precise redshifts and exquisite completeness within z = 0.2. After a single year of observations with the upgraded LIGO-A# network, the combined sample of golden and silver dark sirens with z < 0.2 and follow-up VIRUS observations can potentially yield a few-percent constraint on H0. Our predictions suggest that spectroscopic redshift surveys such as HETDEX can play a key role in realizing high-precision cosmology with dark sirens in the near future. Standard-siren distance measurements offer a critical, fully independent path to the local value of H0 to resolve the Hubble tension."}

Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R ~ 10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R ~ 13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \\pm 0.8\\ \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements.

Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $Σ$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects."}

As a major component of the universe, dark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmic evolution, particularly in the formation of large-scale structures. However, its fundamental nature remains elusive. Axion-like particles (ALPs), as promising dark matter candidates, possess unique advantages in naturally explaining such phenomena. Previous studies on the implications of cosmic birefringence for these ultralight ALP fields have focused on single-field models with conventional potentials. These models face exclusion due to the washout effect - a suppression of the CMB polarization power spectrum induced by oscillatory dynamics of the scalar field within the mass range of less than $10^{-23}$ eV. To address this limitation, we develop a more general theoretical framework incorporating two ALP fields, providing analytical approximations and numerical calculations. Our findings reveal that the superposition of two ALP fields with distinct masses can relax the constraints imposed by the washout effect and reconcile with observations."}

Each brane could be formed by joining lower-dimensional branes, such as $D_1$ ones. By joining $D_1$ branes, a $D_n$ brane is formed, and some amounts of energy are released. Then, perhaps some dimensions are compacted, and a certain amount of energy is released. These energies cause a significant difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk of branes.

WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be \"native\" from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys.

However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $Σ$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $ΣR$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\\,M_\\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors.

We extract signatures of the modified geometry from the retarded Green functions of the dual conformal field theory. The retarded Green functions can be computed from bulk wave functions of scalar field. We show that exotic compact objects leave two characteristic imprints: bulk-cone singularities and echoes. The bulk-cone singularities correspond to null geodesics in the bulk, allowing us to detect null trajectories that are specific to exotic compact objects. The echoes arise from wave modes trapped inside the photon sphere, and thus signal the absence of a horizon. As concrete examples, we study AdS gravastar and AdS wormhole. We compute the corresponding bulk wave functions both via the WKB approximation and through numerical analysis and observe the bulk-cone singularities and echoes explicitly."}

With recent progress on both theoretical and observational frontiers, we have reached the point where these novel signals of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) can be systematically tested with increasingly precise data. In this paper, we present the results of improved CMB data analysis for cosmological collider signals using Planck CMB data. To set the stage, we first construct a set of simplified but characteristic collider templates which are accurate over a broad range of particle masses, spins and sound speeds. In order to break degeneracies with single-field PNG, we propose an orthogonalization scheme such that the collider templates are uncorrelated with the highly constrained equilateral and orthogonal shapes. On this basis, we deploy the Modal bispectrum estimator for the Planck analysis and perform a systematic scan of parameters to search for the most significant collider signal. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is found to be $2.35σ$ for massive spin-0 exchange after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. In addition, we cross-validate the Modal analysis with the CMB-BEST pipeline, which demonstrates the consistency of results across the benchmark examples of collider templates. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio regime we find at the current stage of PNG observations, we believe the orthogonalization procedure provides an optimized strategy for future tests of the cosmological collider with the ability to rule out single field inflation."}

A uniform use of the invariant mass $M_0$ in both hadronic matrix elements and Lorentz prefactors enforces four-momentum conservation at the meson--quark vertex and yields current-component--independent observables, removing light-front zero-mode ambiguities. Properly normalized electromagnetic form factor $F_{K^+}(Q^2)$ is exemplified as a current-component--independent observable by verifying its uniqueness with the explicit computation from all the available components ($γ^+$, $γ^\\perp$, and $γ^-$) of the current. In the scalar channel, we compare the direct $f_S(Q^2)$ and mass-factored $F_S(Q^2)$ definitions and show they are not interchangeable within the BT-based LFQM because $M\\to M_0(x,{\\bf k}_\\perp)$ must be implemented inside the integral.

Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $Σ$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types.

The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies.

However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $Σ$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $ΣR$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\\,M_\\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors."}

This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called \"crease set\". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux & Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux & Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity."}

A Monte Carlo ensemble of CFFs, obtained from a global neural-network fit to unpolarized DVCS measurements with propagated experimental uncertainties, serves as input to a replica ensemble of GPD networks, yielding a fully probabilistic extraction of $H^{(+)}$ over the phase space.

Each brane could be formed by joining lower-dimensional branes, such as $D_1$ ones. By joining $D_1$ branes, a $D_n$ brane is formed, and some amounts of energy are released. Then, perhaps some dimensions are compacted, and a certain amount of energy is released. These energies cause a significant difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk of branes. This causes the evolution of the universe and many changes in thermodynamic parameters, such as entropy, as well as cosmic parameters, including the Hubble constant.

Consequently, we obtain the masses of the candidate bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\\,0^+,\\,1^-,\\,1^+$. Our results show that the central values of the $Λ_c\\barΣ_c$ bound-state masses lie around the $5.8~\\mathrm{GeV}$ region, consistent with the findings reported by the BESIII Collaboration. Furthermore, we compute the mass spectrum of the $Λ_b\\barΣ_b$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\\,0^+,\\,1^-,\\,1^+$, which could be served as hidden-bottom candidates in the experimental detecting."}

We revisit this question in JT gravity from two perspectives: the closed-channel bulk path integral and the path integral over boundary curves. First, we study the radial evolution of a closed universe and derive the trumpet wavefunction as a transition amplitude between a geodesic boundary and a finite Dirichlet boundary. Our analysis recovers the Hartle--Hawking wavefunction without imposing asymptotic boundary conditions, allowing the trumpet to be glued to a cap wavefunction to reconstruct the smooth disk. Second, we derive an exact Riccati equation for the extrinsic curvature of a finite-cutoff boundary curve in the Euclidean Poincaré disk. A WKB expansion of this equation yields all perturbative corrections in the cutoff parameter and captures nonperturbative effects. From this, we compute the quadratic boundary action and the one-loop partition function at finite cutoff, finding agreement with both the bulk approach and the expected one-loop effective action for the $T\\bar{T}$ deformation of the Schwarzian theory. Extracting lessons from JT gravity, we then argue that similar relationships hold for general dilaton gravities with arbitrary potentials $V(φ)$ and propose an exact expression for their finite cutoff partition functions. We finally investigate several signatures of UV completeness in these settings, introducing a canonical quantization approach within the finite cutoff framework."}

We extract signatures of the modified geometry from the retarded Green functions of the dual conformal field theory. The retarded Green functions can be computed from bulk wave functions of scalar field. We show that exotic compact objects leave two characteristic imprints: bulk-cone singularities and echoes. The bulk-cone singularities correspond to null geodesics in the bulk, allowing us to detect null trajectories that are specific to exotic compact objects. The echoes arise from wave modes trapped inside the photon sphere, and thus signal the absence of a horizon. As concrete examples, we study AdS gravastar and AdS wormhole. We compute the corresponding bulk wave functions both via the WKB approximation and through numerical analysis and observe the bulk-cone singularities and echoes explicitly."}

In total, we have successfully realized seven different two-zero textures.

We further probe these two-zero textures at the long-baseline neutrino experiments DUNE and T2HK.

In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $ξφ^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe."}

While a bright siren -- a GW event with an identified electromagnetic (EM) counterpart -- provided the first such constraint, most detections, currently dominated by black hole mergers, lack EM signatures. A measurement of H0 is still possible with these dark sirens by statistically associating GW events with galaxies in existing catalogs based on the sky localization. In this work, we explore the potential of two subsets of sirens: rare golden dark sirens, for which a single galaxy dominates the H0 posterior, and silver dark sirens, which are far more common but have a larger set of plausible host galaxies. Using the fifth internal data release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we assess the suitability of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for spectroscopic follow-up of dark sirens. VIRUS exposures of the standard HETDEX depth provide precise redshifts and exquisite completeness within z = 0.2. After a single year of observations with the upgraded LIGO-A# network, the combined sample of golden and silver dark sirens with z < 0.2 and follow-up VIRUS observations can potentially yield a few-percent constraint on H0. Our predictions suggest that spectroscopic redshift surveys such as HETDEX can play a key role in realizing high-precision cosmology with dark sirens in the near future. Standard-siren distance measurements offer a critical, fully independent path to the local value of H0 to resolve the Hubble tension."}

This naturally avoids the stringent electric dipole moment experimental constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of CP violation.

We show that the required thermal history and successful baryogenesis lead to a predictive scenario, testable in the near future by a combination of LHC searches and low-energy flavour measurements.

The structure of the Ward-Takahashi identities are similarly fully determined. As an application, we derive four massless spin-1/2 WFC due to graviton exchange. We also revisit the tension between conserved spin-3/2 operators and de Sitter geometry. We demonstrate that the reality conditions appropriate to dS and Euclidean AdS (EAdS) lead to distinct three-point WFCs for two spin-3/2 operators and the stress tensor. Consequently, the residue of the leading total-energy pole for the four-point WFC receives graviton- and photon-exchange contributions with opposite signs in dS, whereas they appear with the same sign in EAdS.

At the same time, they furnish interesting LHC signatures in the form of TeV-scale resonances of the $X,Y$-like bosons, providing a trace of the grand-unified group, accessible at low energies. Using the method of Planck-brane correlators allows us to evolve the couplings consistently from the electroweak scale up to the Planck scale, avoiding shortcomings of other frequently-used approaches and including the effects of bulk scalars, fermions, and gauge-bosons within a common framework. We thereby revisit, contrast, and supplement results in the literature, the latter for example by including brane masses and the gauge-Higgs vacuum expectation value.

For non-abelian gauge theories, this proposal is verified, to all perturbative orders, by dipole color correlations in the infrared factor of non-abelian scattering amplitudes, which are given by a correlator of matrix-valued vertex operators in a free-boson theory on the sphere. Decades of high-order gauge-theory calculations have provided a number of further results that can be used to test and constrain a possible celestial theory: they include explicit expressions for soft emission currents up to three particles, and up to three loops for single soft emission. In this paper, we analyze this trove of data, appropriately translated in the celestial language, and we use them to extract information on the celestial theory. In particular, we show that all logarithms arising in the loop expansion of the single soft current can be reabsorbed in the scale choices for the $d$-dimensional coupling, casting some doubt on the need for a logarithmic celestial theory. We then note that the celestial OPEs suggested by the structure of multiple emission currents in collinear limits are never ambiguous, but involve coefficients depending on gluon energy fractions, which break holomorphic factorization, as well as associativity when double limits are taken. Strongly-ordered soft limits recover associativity, but suffer from ambiguities already discussed in earlier literature."}

Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency."}

In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $ξφ^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe."}

As a major component of the universe, dark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmic evolution, particularly in the formation of large-scale structures. However, its fundamental nature remains elusive. Axion-like particles (ALPs), as promising dark matter candidates, possess unique advantages in naturally explaining such phenomena. Previous studies on the implications of cosmic birefringence for these ultralight ALP fields have focused on single-field models with conventional potentials. These models face exclusion due to the washout effect - a suppression of the CMB polarization power spectrum induced by oscillatory dynamics of the scalar field within the mass range of less than $10^{-23}$ eV. To address this limitation, we develop a more general theoretical framework incorporating two ALP fields, providing analytical approximations and numerical calculations. Our findings reveal that the superposition of two ALP fields with distinct masses can relax the constraints imposed by the washout effect and reconcile with observations."}

In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(φ)=m^{2}φ^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor. Our results provide a systematic and broadly applicable prescription for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, with potential applications to a wider class of minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity."}

For non-abelian gauge theories, this proposal is verified, to all perturbative orders, by dipole color correlations in the infrared factor of non-abelian scattering amplitudes, which are given by a correlator of matrix-valued vertex operators in a free-boson theory on the sphere. Decades of high-order gauge-theory calculations have provided a number of further results that can be used to test and constrain a possible celestial theory: they include explicit expressions for soft emission currents up to three particles, and up to three loops for single soft emission. In this paper, we analyze this trove of data, appropriately translated in the celestial language, and we use them to extract information on the celestial theory. In particular, we show that all logarithms arising in the loop expansion of the single soft current can be reabsorbed in the scale choices for the $d$-dimensional coupling, casting some doubt on the need for a logarithmic celestial theory. We then note that the celestial OPEs suggested by the structure of multiple emission currents in collinear limits are never ambiguous, but involve coefficients depending on gluon energy fractions, which break holomorphic factorization, as well as associativity when double limits are taken. Strongly-ordered soft limits recover associativity, but suffer from ambiguities already discussed in earlier literature."}

We derive analytical expressions for both the quasinormal mode frequencies and the radial wave functions.

For identical quantum numbers, the frequency expression and the degree of degeneracy are the same for all massless spin particles, regardless of their specific properties. This implies that, through the observation of quasinormal modes, one can not only determine the black hole's parameters but also observe the phenomenon in which one type of particle reproduces the quasinormal mode of another. Our work thus provides a theoretical foundation for understanding this mimicking behavior as well."}

It is found that for spin particles, curved spacetime induces an effective complex potential analogous to a Coulomb field. While the real part of this potential contributes a real logarithmic term to the phase, the imaginary part gives rise to a corresponding imaginary logarithmic term. Crucially, this imaginary term is precisely responsible for generating the correct asymptotic decay of the wave function. From this framework, a unified analytical expression for the differential cross section is derived, applicable to all particle types considered. Given the successful fabrication of a Schwarzschild-equivalent medium via transformation optics, our theoretical scattering predictions can be tested experimentally by transmitting plane electromagnetic waves through such a structure. Insights gained from these experiments could, in turn, shed light on the scattering of other massless fields (e.g., gravitational waves) by actual black holes."}

Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, the temperature decreases with mass near the evaporation endpoint, signaling a phase transition and possible stable remnant. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies. The result of this study establishes the finiteness of the radiation entropy and consistency with quantum mechanics."}

Previously found domain-wall Skyrmions are bosons with the baryon number two. In this paper, we show that the minimum domain-wall Skyrmions are fermions with the baryon number one; a bosonic domain-wall Skyrmion can be separated without cost of energy into two fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions attached on the opposite sides of a chiral soliton.

The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.\n  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,Φ)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $Λ$.
