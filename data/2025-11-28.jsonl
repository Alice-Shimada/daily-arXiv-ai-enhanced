Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $σ$ allows for the coupling $N S σ$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\\rightarrow Sσ$), and (ii) for $T_{\\rm EW}<T_{\\rm rh}\\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\\rightarrow SS$ at one loop).

Alternatively, if $σ-h$ coupling is small, then $σ$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($σ\\rightarrow Sν$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($Δ{N}_{\\rm eff}$).

A previous global analysis of 2024 oscillation data estimated $δm^2$ and $\\sin^2θ_{12}$ with fractional $1σ$ errors of about $2.3\\%$ and $4.5\\%$, respectively. First we update the analysis by applying the latest SNO+ constraints, that slightly shift the $(δm^2,\\,\\sin^2θ_{12})$ best fits. Then we apply the constraints placed by the first JUNO results, that significantly reduce the uncertainties of both parameters. Our updated global bounds (as of 2025) can be summarized as: $δm^2/10^{-5}{\\rm eV}^2 = 7.48\\pm 0.10$ and $\\sin^2θ_{12}=0.3085\\pm0.0073$ (with correlation $ρ=-0.20$), corresponding to $1σ$ uncertainties as small as $1.3\\%$ and $2.4\\%$, respectively. We also comment on minor physical and statistical effects that, in the future, may contribute to lift the current mass-ordering degeneracy of $(δm^2,\\,θ_{12})$ estimates."}

Existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging does not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine whether the background quasar is multiply imaged. Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy. The estimated mass ($\\log(M_{*} / M_{\\odot}) = 11.15 \\pm 0.16$) and redshift ($z_{\\text{phot}} = 3.62_{-0.04}^{+0.06}$) of the foreground galaxy are consistent with a single-image lensing model. We estimate the maximum possible magnification of the quasar to be $μ_{\\text{max}} = 3.2$, which implies that the intrinsic Eddington ratio of the quasar is at least $λ_{\\text{Edd}}^{\\text{intrinsic}} > 4.9$. Therefore, J0025-0145 has one of the highest Eddington ratios among $z>5$ supermassive black holes known so far, suggesting the viability of super-Eddington growth for supermassive black holes in the early universe."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \\to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components."}

For submission to the Open Journal of Astrophysics", "summary": "We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for evidence of a correlation between radio variability and the detection of astrophysical neutrinos. We find an excess number of associations between flaring radio sources and neutrinos that were detected between the first and second VLASS observations at $>2σ$ confidence. This excess is consistent with radio flares contributing $\\sim13\\,\\%$ of the astrophysical neutrinos observed by IceCube. Notably $>80\\,\\%$ of the radio flares associated with neutrinos are not detected at either $γ$-ray or X-ray wavelengths, highlighting the importance of radio observations for identifying potential electromagnetic counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos. No excess in the number of associations between the wider radio-variable population and the IceCube neutrinos is seen when no time constraint is placed on the neutrino detection. We predict that data from future VLASS epochs will see an excess number of associations between radio flares and neutrinos at the $>3σ$ level, and expected improvements to the positional constraints on the neutrinos may increase that confidence to $>5σ$, should our results be representative."}
