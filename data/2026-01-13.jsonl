In this work, we investigate this \"back-reaction\" of baryons on dark matter using thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, including parameter variations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (> 450% increase at r < 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k ~ 10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation. These results emphasize the need for marginalizing over uncertainties in baryonic physics to extract cosmological information from weak lensing surveys as well as their potential to constrain feedback models in galaxy evolution."}

Using observationally anchored mass-radius relations and a density profile consistent with established equations of state, we construct a piecewise model that explicitly integrates the neutron-drip line, nuclear-saturation, the electron-dominated halo, and core-crust interfaces. The resulting structure reproduces the stiffness and curvature behavior across the nuclear-pasta regime reported in the literature, validating our treatment of the crust-core transition. From this model, we derive updated moments of inertia, crustal mass fractions, and the effective number of neutrons contributing to the star's magnetic moment. Comparing these quantities with spin-down inferred magnetic dipole moments indicates that the observed magnetic fields of particularly millisecond pulsars can be sustained entirely by the crustal neutron polarization, requiring alignment of only about $\\lesssim5.5\\%$ ($99\\%$ C.L.) of the neutrons in the crust. This finding supports a crust-confined magnetic-field origin for non-magnetar neutron stars, consistent with magneto-thermal evolution studies, and provides a quantitative framework for connecting neutron-star observables to its underlying structure."}

This new diagnostics utilizes coherent rotation of void galaxies, which can be observed as redshift asymmetry in opposite sides dichotomized by the projected spin axes of hosting voids. Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $Λ$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation."}

We discuss the properties of the phase transition at high-density, considering an effective theory describing the high-density heavy-quark limit of QCD. This effective theory is a simple model in which the Polyakov loop is a dynamical variable, and the quark Boltzmann factor is controlled by only one parameter, $C(μ,m_q)$, which is a function of the quark mass $m_q$ and the chemical potential $μ$. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy-quark region. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD."}

Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly \"disruptors\", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics."}

However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades."}

This poses a serious problem in the interpretation of both observations and numerical simulations. In this paper, we use filtering operators in real space to separate bulk motion from turbulence at different scales. We show how filters can be used to define consistent kinetic and magnetic energies for the bulk and turbulent component. We apply our GPU-accelerated filtering pipeline to a simulation of a major galaxy cluster merger, which is part of the PICO-Clusters suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive clusters using the moving mesh code Arepo and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We find that during the merger the turbulent pressure fraction on physical scales $\\lesssim$160 kpc reaches a maximum of 5%, before decreasing to 2% after $\\sim$1.3 Gyr from the core passage. These low values are consistent with recent observations of clusters with XRISM, and suggest that unless a cluster was recently perturbed by a major merger, turbulence levels are low. We then re-examine the popular multiscale iterative filter method. In our tests, we find that its use can introduce artifacts, and that it does not reliably disentangle fluctuations living on widely separated length scales. Rather, we believe it is more fruitful to use fixed-scale filters and turbulent energies to compare between simulations and observations. This work significantly improves our understanding of turbulence generation by major mergers in galaxy clusters, which can be probed by XRISM and next-generation X-ray telescopes, allowing us to connect high-resolution cosmological simulations to observations."}

During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside' rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios.

Using the [OIII]5007 and H$α$ emission lines, we identify broad kinematic components consistent with galactic outflows in 14 galaxies/regions. We find that the outflowing gas is more dust attenuated (by $A_{\\rm V}$$\\sim0.59$ mag on average) and metal-enriched (0.13 dex) than the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxies, but its velocities are insufficient to escape the galaxies and reach the circumgalactic medium, suggesting that outflows mainly redistribute dust and metals around their hosts. The outflows identified in this study display velocity dispersions within $σ_{\\rm out}=130-340$~km~s$^{-1}$ and outflow velocities $v_{\\rm out}=170-600$~km~s$^{-1}$, and, when combined with less luminous and less massive star-forming galaxies from previous works, reveal a statistically significant correlation between $v_{\\rm out}$ and star formation rate (SFR).

The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable."}

Our findings indicate that the model experiences a transition from the early deceleration phase to the late-time cosmic acceleration, and the transition occurs at a redshift $z_{tr} = 0.573$. We also analyse the $om(z)$ diagnostic, which reflects a positive slope, supporting the behavior of the equation of state parameter in the quintessence region."}

In particular, coronagraph instrumentation needs to be matured for higher throughput, deeper contrasts, and better broadband performance, while also considering their sensitivity and ability to mitigate the impact of telescope instability and wavefront error (WFE), which can have a profound impact on exo-Earth imaging. The success of various proposed HWO mission architectures is often represented by the estimated exo-Earth candidate yield. Computation of the minimum exposure time to achieve the required signal-to-noise on a given target, using an exposure time calculator (ETC), is a key part of yield estimation. The impacts of coronagraph sensitivity, WFE, and wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) have been well studied in the context of developing error budgets for missions and instruments such as the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, but there is currently no easily accessible way to incorporate the effects of these key parameters into calculating exposure times for HWO. To address this, we developed the Error Budget Software (EBS) - an open-source tool that synthesizes sensitivity, WFE, and WFS&C information for a variety of temporal and spatial scales and directly interfaces with the open-source yield code EXOSIMS to produce exposure times. We demonstrate how EBS can be used for mission error budgeting using the example of the Ultrastable Observatory Roadmap Team (USORT) observatory design. This includes both single and multi-variate parameter explorations using EBS where we identify trends between raw contrast and wavefront error, and detector noise and energy resolution."}

We examine how dust grain distributions and environmental parameters determine the peak frequency and spectral width of AME spectral energy distribution (SED). Using Monte Carlo sampling and global sensitivity analysis, we find that AME features are dominantly controlled by three parameters: grain size, shape, and a phase-dependent environmental parameter. We also quantify the effects of SED broadening from ensembles of these dominant parameters, finding that the level of tension with observations is strongly phase dependent: Molecular Cloud (MC) is fully consistent, Dark Cloud (DC) shows minor deviations, and HII regions exhibit significant offsets in peak frequency. This points to possible issues in phase-dependent AME extraction, interstellar medium (ISM) environment identification, or underlying theoretical tension. Ensemble variations in both grain size and environmental parameters are required to reproduce the observed spread in peak frequency and spectral width. We further propose moment expansion and emulation-based inference methods for future AME spectral fit and feature analysis."}

By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $θ_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state."}

In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses.

In this model, four input parameters are required to completely parametrize the electroweak precision observables at one loop. We study the quantitative impact of the model parameters on the one-loop corrections to the $ρ$ parameter.

We show that satellite galaxies are significantly affected by the environment in all simulation models, with their gas fraction and star formation rate (SFR) suppressed in overdense regions compared to similar mass satellites in underdense environments at $z=0$. Central galaxies are less sensitive to environment but tend to show lower gas fraction and SFR in overdense regions at low stellar mass, transitioning to higher gas fraction and SFR for massive galaxies in higher-density environments. Halo baryon fraction ($f_{\\rm B}$) and circumgalactic medium mass fraction ($f_{\\rm CGM}$) at $z=0$ show clear environmental effects. In SIMBA, low-mass haloes in overdense regions have systematically lower $f_{\\rm B}$ and $f_{\\rm CGM}$ at fixed halo mass, while Swift-EAGLE haloes in overdense regions have systematically higher $f_{\\rm B}$ and $f_{\\rm CGM}$ across the full halo mass range, and IllustrisTNG and ASTRID show opposite trends at the low and high mass ends. Environmental effects can flip at higher redshift, with SFR and $f_{\\rm B}$ increasing with local density in low-mass haloes before quenching at an increasing overdensity threshold. Our results demonstrate that the impact of environment on galaxy evolution depends significantly on galaxy formation model, and higher-density environments can either suppress or enhance star formation depending on galaxy mass and cosmic epoch."}

Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms."}

We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime.

These groups contain 20-30 galaxies with high (>75%) membership probability. Our study reveals both passive-density and active-density relations: late-type galaxies (LTGs) prefer higher central overdensities than early-type galaxies (ETGs) across all groups, and many massive LTGs exhibit colors typical of quiescent galaxies. We identify red sequences (RS) in 5 groups, prominently established at z < 1, with early emergence in the RS locus up to z ~ 2.2.\n  This suggests group environments represent a transitional phase where star formation quenching precedes morphological transformation, contrasting with the classical morphology-density relation in rich clusters. In the central regions (~33 arcsec / 100 kpc from centers), we identified 86 galaxies: 23 (~27%) ETGs and 63 (~73%) LTGs. High-mass galaxies (M_star > 10^10.5 M_sun) undergo rapid quenching over ~1 Gyr, becoming predominantly spheroidal ETGs. This indicates morphological transformation accelerates in massive systems during peak cosmic star formation. Intermediate-mass galaxies (10^9 < M_star/M_sun < 10^10.5) show mild quenching, while low-mass galaxies (M_star < 10^9 M_sun) remain largely star-forming; here, environmental processes suppress star formation without destroying disks, suggesting group quenching operates on longer timescales than mass quenching. Overall, mass-dependent quenching dominates the high-mass end, while environment shapes lower-mass systems. The HLAGN fraction for both groups and field increases with redshift, peaking at z ~ 2, with groups consistently showing higher fractions. We suggest AGN feedback partially drives rapid quenching in high-mass galaxies, while mergers may trigger AGN activity."}

While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $Λ$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."}

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger."}

We intend to derive consistent natural magnitudes for celestial sources within the intrinsic photometric systems of astronomical photographic plates by using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) blue photometer (BP) and red photometer (RP) low-resolution spectral data and to show its superiority to former methods. Methods. We compiled spectral characteristic data for emulsions and filters applied in photometric observations using glass plates. The collected color sensitivities, modified by atmospheric reddening depending on the air mass, are then used to compute accurate natural magnitudes and fluxes of objects in the photographic plates through synthetic photometry, utilizing a catalog of Gaia spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the wavelength range 330 nm to 1050 nm (XP spectra). This process uses GaiaXPy, a Python library designed to handle Gaia DR3 spectral data. These natural magnitudes are then compared with results from the color term method used to compile the data in existing photoplate archives. Results. Comparing the synthetic magnitudes with those existing in the Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE), we were able to reveal systematic errors of the existing data in the range of +/-0.3 mag and higher. In addition, the presented method allows for an accommodation of stars with similar color index but of different luminosity classes as well as an effective correction of atmospheric reddening at higher air masses, approximately 0.2 mag."}

While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations."}

Using the first cloud-cloud collision simulations that model individual star formation and accretion with all stellar feedback mechanisms, we explore the morphological evolution, star formation efficiency (SFE), fragmentation, stellar mass distribution, and feedback-driven gas dispersal. Our results show that cloud collisions substantially enhance the rate and timing of star formation compared to isolated scenarios, though the final SFE remains broadly similar across all setups. Lower collision velocities facilitate prolonged gravitational interaction and accumulation of gas, promoting sustained star formation characterized by elongated filamentary structures. Conversely, high-velocity collisions induce rapid gas compression and turbulent motions, leading to intense but transient episodes of star formation, which are curtailed by feedback-driven dispersal. The orientation of the magnetic field markedly affects collision outcomes. Parallel fields allow gas to collapse efficiently along magnetic lines, forming fewer but more massive stars. In contrast, perpendicular fields generate significant magnetic pressure, which stabilizes the shock-compressed gas and delays gravitational collapse, resulting in more distributed and less massive stellar fragments. Radiative feedback from massive stars consistently regulates star formation, halting further gas accretion at moderate efficiencies (10-15%) and initiating feedback-driven dispersal. Although the cloud dynamics vary significantly, the stellar mass function remains robust across scenarios-shaped modestly by magnetic orientation but only weakly influenced by collision velocity."}

This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory.

M.-G. Park found that the mass accretion rate, specifically, decreases significantly as the gas angular momentum increases. However, R. Narayan & A. C. Fabian found the decrease modest. We investigate global solutions for rotating polytropic flows in a much wider parameter space to understand their general properties within the slim disk approximation and a viscosity description suitable for both low- and high-angular-momentum flows. We find that the mass accretion rate for flows with a small Bondi radius decreases steeply as the gas angular momentum increases, while for those with a large Bondi radius, it decreases gradually. Therefore, the decrease of mass accretion rate due to gas rotation can be significant or mild depending on the Bondi radius. We further investigate global solutions of accretion with outflows using the ADIOS model of R. D. Blandford & M. C. Begelman. Stronger outflows in general slightly increase the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary, but the actual mass accreted into the black hole decreases by orders of magnitude. Stronger outflows also weaken the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the gas angular momentum when the viscosity parameter α is small. The intricate dependence of the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary and the mass accretion rate into the black hole on gas angular momentum will have interesting implications for the growth of black holes and their energy output."}

We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results."}

We introduce a simple free-fall-based switching criterion for general stellar systems, alongside the commonly used velocity-dispersion-based ($σ$-based) criterion. Using the \\textsc{petar} code with the P$^3$T scheme and slow-down algorithmic regularization for binaries and higher-order multiples, we perform extensive simulations of star clusters to evaluate how each criterion affects energy conservation and binary evolution. For systems in virial equilibrium, we find that the free-fall-based criterion is generally more accurate for low-$σ$ or loose clusters containing binaries, whereas the $σ$-based criterion is better suited for high-$σ$ systems. Under subvirial or fractal initial conditions, both criteria struggle to maintain high energy conservation; however, the free-fall-based criterion improves as the tree timestep is reduced, whereas the $σ$-based degrades due to its low-accuracy treatment of two-body encounters."}

In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs."}

This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere. It is noteworthy to observe that quantum features of fields do not entirely dissipate in the quantum atmosphere region, indicating that tasks related to quantum information processing can still be executed there."}

In light of recent gravity results one would expect much like the ground state degeneracy this fine tuned condition too will not be met. It is unclear though whether this should be a quantum artefact or classical. In this paper we consider a non-BPS extremal four-charge Reissner Nordstrom black hole in N = 8 String theory. It is shown that the microscopic D-brane description fails to admit any extremal state, even classically. This positive energy is expected to destabilize the near horizon AdS2. The positive minimum energy is a direct consequence of the pattern of supersymmetry breaking by the D-branes. The black hole entropy is found to be the logarithm of the number of isolated minima and hence is related to the configurational entropy of the microscopic potential. We also find multiple continua of local minima corresponding to marginally bound states of the constituent D-branes."}

In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of a data cube treatment methodology, previously proposed by our research group, for analyses focused on the stellar and gas kinematics. To do that, we used data cubes of the central regions of the galaxies NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, obtained with the Integral Field Unit of the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. For each galaxy, we analysed three data cubes: non-treated, filtered (with the Butterworth spatial filtering) and filtered and deconvolved (with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution). For each data cube, we performed a dynamical modelling, using Jeans Anisotropic Models, to obtain, among other parameters, the masses of the central supermassive black holes. Both for NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, the values of the parameters provided by the dynamical modelling from the non-treated, filtered and filtered and deconvolved data cubes were compatible, at the 1-$σ$ level. However, the use of the Butterworth spatial filtering decreased the uncertainty of the parameters. The additional use of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution decreased even more the uncertainty of the parameters. The complete data treatment procedure resulted in decreases of 41% and 45% in the uncertainties of the supermassive black hole masses in NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, respectively. These results indicate that our treatment procedure not only does not compromise analyses of data cubes focused on the stellar or gas kinematics, but actually improves the quality of the results."}

In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB.

We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Guided by the flipping principle, we propose a novel extension of the Standard Model based on a double right-handed $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. In this framework, all left-handed fermions are neutral, while right-handed fermions of the third generation carry charges distinct from those of the first two generations. This structure naturally explains the observed Standard Model fermion mass hierarchy: the heavy masses of the third generation are generated at tree level, while the lighter masses of the first and second generations arise radiatively at the one-loop level. For the active neutrino sector, the tiny masses are generated through a combination of tree-level and two-loop seesaw mechanisms. Crucially, this approach successfully reproduces the observed neutrino mass hierarchy, with the atmospheric mass-squared difference generated at tree level and the solar neutrino mass squared difference emerging at the two-loop level. These hierarchical patterns stem from the interplay between gauge invariance and a residual parity symmetry that survives the spontaneous breaking of the extended gauge group. The same residual symmetry stabilizes a viable scalar singlet dark matter candidate, which we show can reproduce the observed relic abundance while remaining consistent with current direct detection bounds. After addressing constraints from electroweak precision tests and flavor-changing neutral currents, we explore the discovery prospects for the new neutral bosons at existing and future colliders, including the LEP, LHC, and a future ILC."}

Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.\n  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Atomic hydrogen (HI) regulates star formation as cold gas fuels star formation. It represents a key phase of matter in the baryon cycle involving accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. Redshifted $21$ cm line emission originating from galaxies serves as a key tracer for investigating HI gas and its dynamics in the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), and enables the study of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, direct detections of HI are currently limited to $z \\leq 0.4$ due to the inherently weak $21$ cm emission line. Ongoing and upcoming large radio surveys aim to detect $21$ cm emission from galaxies up to $z \\gtrsim 1$ with unprecedented sensitivity. In current work, we present a novel approach for creating optical-HI joint mock catalogs for upcoming SKA precursor surveys: MIGHTEE-HI and LADUMA with MeerKAT and WALLABY with ASKAP. Incorporation of optical properties along with HI in our mock catalogs makes these a powerful tool for making predictions for upcoming surveys and provides a benchmark for exploring the HI science (e.g., conditional HIMF and optical-to-HI scaling relations) expected from these surveys. As a case study, we show the use of the joint catalogs for predicting the expected outcome of stacking detection for average HI mass in galaxies that are below the threshold for direct detection. We show that combining stacking observations with the number of direct detections puts a strong constraint on the HI mass function, especially in the regime where the number of direct detections is small, as often happens near the farther edge of HI surveys. This intermediate step may be used to set priors for the full determination of the HI mass function."}

Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1<z<2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 < z < 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."}

We construct a semi-analytic model of galaxy ellipticities and alignments in the \\Euclid Flagship simulation to predict this contamination in Euclid's weak lensing observations. Galaxy shapes and orientations are determined by the corresponding properties of the host haloes in the underlying $N$-body simulation, as well as the relative positions of galaxies within their halo. Alignment strengths are moderated via stochastic misalignments, separately for central and satellite galaxies and conditional on the galaxy's redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame colour. The resulting model is calibrated against galaxy ellipticity statistics from the COSMOS Survey, selected alignment measurements based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey samples, and galaxy orientations extracted from the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamic simulation at redshift $z=1$. The best-fit model has a total of 12 alignment parameters and generally reproduces the calibration data sets well within the $1σ$ statistical uncertainties of the observations and the \\flagship simulation, with notable exceptions for the most luminous sub-samples on small physical scales. The statistical power of the calibration data and the volume of the single \\flagship realisation are still too small to provide informative prior ranges for intrinsic alignment amplitudes in relevant galaxy samples. As a first application, we predict that \\Euclid end-of-mission tomographic weak gravitational lensing two-point statistics are modified by up to order $10\\,\\%$ due to intrinsic alignments."}

Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordström, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\\mathcal{O}(Λ)$ and mixed $\\mathcal{O}(ΛM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle."}

We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models.

The so entangled triplet of quark fields satisfies a generalized Dirac equation, with generalized 12x1é gamma-matrices acting on 12-component coloured spinors.

We point out that the validity of several widely studied holographic inequalities -- including the AdS Penrose inequality, the late-time bound on entanglement entropy growth, and the growth-rate limits of CV and CA complexities -- depends on the choice of quantization schemes. Motivated by this issue, we introduce a modified total energy, which is still computed via holographic renormalization but the final value is independent of the choice of quantization schemes. We verify that this new ``total energy'' restores all these bounds to universal validity in the model of generalized free scalar field theory. Our results suggest that our modified total energy provides a more robust notion of energy when we talk about above inequalities in holographic settings."}

Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), Hα (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The Hα component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components."}

Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to \"hot dust\", \"cold dust\", \"nearby dust\", and \"Halpha correlated dust\", respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes."}

It is seen that that the source 2-form involves terms that are quadratic in energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms as well as terms that depend on covariant derivatives of them. In addition, we derive the consistency relation in order that matter-coupled EGMG field equation be third-way consistent. In general, the consistency requires a particular relation that should be satisfied by energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms.

However, ground-based studies of the full carbon cycle have been limited by atmospheric absorption. Dome~A, the most promising site for submillimeter astronomy, has long resisted successful submillimeter astronomical observations. Using the 60~cm Antarctic Terahertz Explorer, we present the first successful CO ($4-3$) and [CI] ($^3P_1 - ^3P_0$) mapping observations of two archetypal triggered massive star-formation regions at Dome~A. These data, together with archival [CII], provide the first complete characterization of all three carbon phases in these environments. We find elevated C$^{0}$/CO abundance ratios in high-extinction regions, plausibly driven by deep penetration of intense radiation fields from massive stars into a clumpy ISM. These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome~A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM."}

We show that charge-conjugation symmetry enforces the exact vanishing of all odd Gegenbauer moments and odd $ξ$-moments. For pseudoscalar quarkonium, the twist-2 and twist-3 LCDAs become identical, which lead to their Gegenbauer moments, $ξ$-moments, and transverse momentum moments are the same, respectively. For vector quarkonium, although the twist-2 and twist-3 LCDAs differ in the case of masses quark, they progressively converge as the quark mass increases. In the heavy-quark limit, all quarkonium LCDAs satisfy $φ^A_{2} = φ^P_{3} \\simeq φ^{\\parallel}_{2} \\simeq φ^{\\perp}_{3}$, demonstrating an emergent twist-independence of quarkonium distribution amplitudes. We further find that the LCDAs become increasingly peaked and narrower with increasing quark mass, reflecting the meson system becomes increasingly close to a nonrelativistic bound state, with a more uniform and stable distribution of internal longitudinal momentum. For all quarkonium, the peak value exhibits a simple phenomenological scaling behavior governed by the ratio $m/β$. The transverse momentum moments increase with the meson mass, indicating a progressively more compact bound-state structure. These results reveal a universal and systematic evolution of quarkonium LCDAs driven by the quark mass."}

Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe."}

Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $χ^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria.

In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly \"disruptors\", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics."}

To derive the initial mass function (IMF) of a large sample of NYMGs, we developed and applied an algorithm that uses photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR3 to detect NYMGs in a kinematic space. We inferred individual masses from the photometry of both the detected and the previously known candidates. We estimated the IMFs for 33 groups, 30 of them for the first time, in an average mass range $0.1<m/M_\\odot<5$ with some groups going as low as $0.02~M_{\\odot}$ and as high as $10~M_{\\odot}$.

This poses a serious problem in the interpretation of both observations and numerical simulations. In this paper, we use filtering operators in real space to separate bulk motion from turbulence at different scales. We show how filters can be used to define consistent kinetic and magnetic energies for the bulk and turbulent component. We apply our GPU-accelerated filtering pipeline to a simulation of a major galaxy cluster merger, which is part of the PICO-Clusters suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive clusters using the moving mesh code Arepo and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We find that during the merger the turbulent pressure fraction on physical scales $\\lesssim$160 kpc reaches a maximum of 5%, before decreasing to 2% after $\\sim$1.3 Gyr from the core passage. These low values are consistent with recent observations of clusters with XRISM, and suggest that unless a cluster was recently perturbed by a major merger, turbulence levels are low. We then re-examine the popular multiscale iterative filter method. In our tests, we find that its use can introduce artifacts, and that it does not reliably disentangle fluctuations living on widely separated length scales. Rather, we believe it is more fruitful to use fixed-scale filters and turbulent energies to compare between simulations and observations. This work significantly improves our understanding of turbulence generation by major mergers in galaxy clusters, which can be probed by XRISM and next-generation X-ray telescopes, allowing us to connect high-resolution cosmological simulations to observations."}

Infrared interferometry with VLTI/GRAVITY is now resolving BLR-scale emission, with data for NGC 3783 consistent with a rotating, geometrically thick configuration. However, the processes shaping the spectra remain poorly constrained, and the cloud models are tuned phenomenologically rather than derived from first-principles predictions. We address this by coupling three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of gas around a supermassive black hole with radiative-transfer calculations using Cloudy, comparing the results to the SINFONI Br$γ$ profile of NGC 3783. We find that Br$γ$ arises from ionized gas in the surface of the rotating thin disk, with electron temperatures of approximately $T_e \\approx 10^4$ K and number densities of $n_e \\approx 10^8-10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intrinsic line profile produced by the RHD kinematics is narrower than observed and displays substructure. An approximate treatment of the electron scattering suggests that scattering in surrounding diffuse ionized gas significantly broadens and smooths the intrinsic Br$γ$ profile, making it consistent with the observed profile. This scattering medium has an electron temperature of $10^4 - 10^5$ K, and a number density of $n \\lesssim 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Although a best-fit viewing angle of $\\approx 15$ deg is suggested, the scattered line is notably less sensitive to inclination than the intrinsic line.

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger."}

These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document.

We examine how dust grain distributions and environmental parameters determine the peak frequency and spectral width of AME spectral energy distribution (SED). Using Monte Carlo sampling and global sensitivity analysis, we find that AME features are dominantly controlled by three parameters: grain size, shape, and a phase-dependent environmental parameter. We also quantify the effects of SED broadening from ensembles of these dominant parameters, finding that the level of tension with observations is strongly phase dependent: Molecular Cloud (MC) is fully consistent, Dark Cloud (DC) shows minor deviations, and HII regions exhibit significant offsets in peak frequency. This points to possible issues in phase-dependent AME extraction, interstellar medium (ISM) environment identification, or underlying theoretical tension. Ensemble variations in both grain size and environmental parameters are required to reproduce the observed spread in peak frequency and spectral width. We further propose moment expansion and emulation-based inference methods for future AME spectral fit and feature analysis."}

Although the pressure inside of a neutron star is typically assumed to be isotropic, pressure anisotropy can arise from various physical mechanisms, including elasticity, viscosity, and magnetic fields. Previous studies of nonradial stellar quasi-normal mode oscillations with anisotropic pressure have focused primarily on fluid modes. In this paper, we compute, for the first time, spacetime oscillation modes (so-called w-modes) of anisotropic neutron stars. Using a perturbative framework for stellar oscillations with pressure anisotropy, developed previously by some of the authors, together with a phenomenological anisotropy model, we find that both the real and imaginary parts of the w-mode frequencies decrease as the tangential pressure becomes dominant over the radial pressure. Although we do not find any unstable w-modes within the physically viable parameter space, unstable w-modes appear in an unphysical branch of solutions when the tangential pressure strongly dominates the radial one. We also find that the relation between the real part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness is quasi-universal with respect to variations in the equation of state and the degree of pressure anisotropy. In contrast, the relation between the imaginary part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness depends on the degree of anisotropy, but remains equation-of-state universal when the anisotropy is fixed. Finally, we discuss potential mode crossings and the validity of certain approximations that have been shown to work well for w-mode calculations in the isotropic case."}

The apparent extreme smallness of this parameter is known as the strong $CP$ problem.\n  In this work, we provide a careful critical overview of the conceptual assumptions underlying the $θ$ term, focusing on the roles of topology, the definition of topological charge density, rough gauge field configurations, instantons, and anomalies. We contrast the assumptions required to describe QCD at nonzero $θ$ with those sufficient at $θ= 0$, and argue that a vanishing $θ$ term is compatible with a formulation based solely on local gauge invariance and causal locality, without invoking additional global structure.\n  The perspective developed here is intended as a conceptual analysis of the standard formulation of the strong $CP$ problem.

As a case study, we show the use of the joint catalogs for predicting the expected outcome of stacking detection for average HI mass in galaxies that are below the threshold for direct detection. We show that combining stacking observations with the number of direct detections puts a strong constraint on the HI mass function, especially in the regime where the number of direct detections is small, as often happens near the farther edge of HI surveys.

This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism."}

Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordström, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\\mathcal{O}(Λ)$ and mixed $\\mathcal{O}(ΛM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle."}

In contrast, neither propionic acid, CH$_3$CH$_2$C(O)OH, nor glycidol, c-CH$_2$OCHCH$_2$OH (i.e., the most and the least stable species within the C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ family, respectively) were detected, and we provide upper limits on their fractional abundances of $\\leq$1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ and $\\leq$3.7 $\\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Interestingly, all C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ isomers can be synthesized through radical-radical reactions on the surface of dust grains, ultimately tracing back to CO as the parent molecule. We suggest that formation of the detected isomers is mainly driven by successive hydrogenation of CO, producing CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$OH as the primary parent species. Conversely, propionic acid is thought to originate from the oxygenation of CO via the HOCO intermediate, which help us rationalize its non-detection. Overall, our findings notably expand the known chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and provide direct observational evidence that increasingly complex chemistry involving O-bearing species occurs in space."}

Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models.

These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $χ^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria.

We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs.

This study characterizes the properties of this dynamic gas flow. Methods: Combining data from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) with single-dish data from the IRAM30m observatory, we mapped large spatial scales (~81pc^2) at high angular resolution (7.0''x2.6'' corresponding ~2.3x10^4au or ~0.1pc) down to core scales. The spectral setup in the 3mm band covers many spectral lines as well as the continuum emission. Results: The data reveal the proposed west-east converging gas flow in all observed dense gas tracers. We estimate a mass-flow rate along that flow around 10^-3M_sun/yr. Comparing these west-east flow rates to infall rates toward sources along the line of sight, the gas flow rates are roughly a factor of 25 greater than than those along the line of sight. This confirms the dominance of longitudinal motions along the converging gas flow in G28.37. For comparison, in the main north-south IRDC formed by the west-east converging gas flow, infall rates along the line of sight are about an order of magnitude greater than those along the west-east flow. In addition to the kinematic analysis, a comparison of CH_3CN-derived gas temperatures with Herschel-derived dust temperatures typically show higher gas temperatures toward high-density sources. We discuss whether mechanical heating from the conversion of the flow's kinetic energy into thermal energy may explain some of the observed temperature differences. Conclusions: The differences between flow rates along the converging flow, perpendicular to it, and toward the sources at the IRDC center indicate that at the interfaces of converging gas flows - where most of the active star formation takes place - originally more directed gas flows can convert into multidirectional infall motions."}

However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption. Crucially, we show that even without enforcing this condition everywhere, it is violated only in the strong-field interior region and is dynamically restored in the weak-field regime by asymptotic boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a result, consistency with existing black-hole solutions and observational constraints is preserved. Our results establish massive vector-tensor gravity as a unified, natural, and self-consistent framework for compact objects, significantly extending its astrophysical viability beyond black holes and Solar System tests."}

Our study is based on the DREAMS project and combines large-volume uniform-box simulations with high-resolution Milky Way zoom-in runs in a $Λ$WDM cosmology. To ensure consistency between the different simulation sets, we apply calibrations to account for resolution effects, allowing us to exploit the complementary strengths of the two suites. We compare simulated relations, including stellar size, DM mass and fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, and the total-to-stellar mass ratio, with two complementary galaxy samples: the SPARC catalog of nearby spirals and the LVDB catalog of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($Ω_m$, $σ_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio.

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."}

Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit.

We numerically solve for the evolution of $Φ(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(Φ)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation.

We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations. Overall, our findings indicate that gravitational collapse in scalar--tensor gravity can give rise to scenarios that challenge the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, while underscoring the potential observational relevance of singularities formed through BD scalar-field-driven collapse."}

In this study, we present comprehensive EPOS4 model predictions for key global observables in Pb-Pb collisions at $5.36$ TeV.

We take into account dynamical friction, stellar scattering, and gravitational wave emission and compare to the observed relation between core mass deficit and galaxy stellar mass. We find that to match observations, binary hardening in the stellar scattering regime must be about 1.6 times faster than N-body experiments suggest. Most importantly we find that, even assuming a full loss-cone, hardening by stellar scattering alone is insufficient to explain the low frequency turnover seen in the gravitational wave background. This strongly suggests that gas-dynamics play an important role in hardening and provides a reason to be optimistic about electromagnetically visible binary AGN."}

In this work, we investigate this \"back-reaction\" of baryons on dark matter using thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, including parameter variations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (> 450% increase at r < 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k ~ 10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation. These results emphasize the need for marginalizing over uncertainties in baryonic physics to extract cosmological information from weak lensing surveys as well as their potential to constrain feedback models in galaxy evolution."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."}

Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe."}

We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel.

The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."}

Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), Hα (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The Hα component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components."}

Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to \"hot dust\", \"cold dust\", \"nearby dust\", and \"Halpha correlated dust\", respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes."}

In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."}

We include two classes of compact objects, namely bright stars with individual spectral energy densities (SEDs) measured by \\textit{Gaia}, and a combined diffuse background of dim point source emission. Of the 424\\ 829 bright sources that we fit, the number of stars with a flux density detected by WISE at Galactic latitudes $|b|>20^{\\circ}$ at more than $5\\,σ$ is 94\\,680, for an average of 1.36~stars per DIRBE beam area. For each star, we adopt physical parameters ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $\\log g$, and [M/H]) from \\textit{Gaia}; use these to identify a best-fit effective SED with the PHOENIX stellar model library; convolve with the respective DIRBE bandpass; and fit an overall free amplitude per star within the Bayesian end-to-end \\texttt{Cosmoglobe} DR2 framework. The contributions from faint sources are accounted for by coadding all 710\\ 825\\ 587 WISE sources not included as bright stars, and fit one single overall amplitude per DIRBE band.

In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB. One under-explored possibility is to exploit the duty cycle that quantifies the number of sources present in the time domain signal, which can be very different depending on the nature and population of the sources. We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models. Our work motivates the development of specific analysis tools to extract these observables, in order to unlock new cosmological insights with upcoming GW data."}
