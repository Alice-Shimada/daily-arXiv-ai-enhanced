Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair\ninteractions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of\ncompanion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their\nhost galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred\ngalaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more\npronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\\sim$\\,2.5 dex higher) than\nunbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have\nsuppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual\nrole of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven\nenhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate\nkpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when\na star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central\nstarbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and\ncontribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting\nfor both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF\nregulation in interacting galaxies."}

A\nsignificant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid\nvariations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the\narray, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated\nsignal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable\nsensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based\nphase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We\nadopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these\nphase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly\nerratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman\nfiltering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions,\nwhich permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space.

We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble\nconstant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data\nrelease of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on\nprevious work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic\nrescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the\ninclusion of \\emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO\nmeasurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\\theta_*$\nas a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included\nas an independent source of $\\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the\nrobustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent\nalternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our\nprevious work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and\n$69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including\nmeasurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the\nDES Year 3 6$\\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES\nYear 5 supernova analysis.

With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to\nmasses of $\\sim10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers\nsuch as H$\\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star\nformation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316\nH$\\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\\sim4$-$5$ with $\\log(\\rm M_\\star/M_\\odot) =\n6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing\ncluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things'' (ALT)\nsurvey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR\n$\\propto \\mathrm{M}_\\star^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for\nthe H$\\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the\nslope steepens to $\\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on\ntheir own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes\ndiffer significantly from the slope of $\\approx1$ expected from the observed\nevolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing\nthe slope to $\\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter\nwith stellar mass (from $\\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\\star=10^8$ M$_\\odot$ to $0.4$\ndex at M$_\\star=10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$). This tension might be explained by a\n(combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\\alpha$) calibration, a population\nof (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in\nhigh-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify\nthese processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star\nformation histories."}

Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of\na UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc),\nwith a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$.
