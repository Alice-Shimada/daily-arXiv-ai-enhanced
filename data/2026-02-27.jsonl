In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under Möbius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa."}

For HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and HNC, we identified two distinct absorption components that are common to both transitions, whereas a single component was detected in the isotopologue spectra. In this paper, we accurately evaluate the excitation temperatures and their uncertainties from the absorption strengths of these components, and use them to determine the CMB temperature. Uncertainties in the continuum covering factor were propagated into the excitation temperature via Monte Carlo sampling. We further corrected the observed optical depths for biases due to column-density nonuniformity by assuming a lognormal column-density distribution. Under the assumption that the rotational levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derived excitation temperature profiles in the optically thin regime. Because the excitation of HCO$^+$ is biased by an additional velocity component and partial collisional excitation, this species was excluded from the final determination of the CMB temperature. From a weighted mean of the excitation temperatures obtained from HCN and HNC, we determined the CMB temperature at $z\\!=\\!0.68$ to be ${4.50\\pm0.17\\,\\mathrm{K}}$.

These solutions can be parametrized by the period $L$, the mass $M$, and the absolute value of the angular momentum $|J| >0$. We provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of such configurations, without any restriction in terms of the distance between horizons. This is in sharp contrast with the non-zero total angular momentum case, as it was recently established in \\cite{Peraza:2024uto} that static single-horizon periodic solutions cannot be put into rotation if $L < 4M$.

In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\\gtrsim 10^{17}\\ M_{\\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $Ω_{BH} \\lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$--$10^{18}\\ M_{\\odot}$.

Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc."}

We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work."}

On the lattice, we can calculate the corresponding matrix element of two quark-bilinear currents with a relative Euclidean time separation. The reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space requires appropriate dealing with the corresponding inverse problem.

We further extend this analysis to resolvents and observe resurgent wall crossing phenomena between ZZ- and FZZT-branes. Using recent results that relate the Virasoro minimal string to 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we proceed to study the resurgent consequences of summing over the genus in 3d gravity, where we find non-perturbative contributions of doubly exponential type. These statements are then tested using resurgent large-order asymptotics. Lastly, we compute the non-perturbative eigenvalue density for generic hermitian matrix models and identify the change of asymptotic behavior at the edge of the eigenvalue distribution with a Stokes transition. This allows us to identify oscillations in the eigenvalue density with anti-Stokes behavior of FZZT-branes. In the case of 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we comment how this Stokes transition coincides with the onset of black hole behaviour and compute the non-perturbative primary density.

We derive a generalization of the Rindler coordinates appropriate for arbitrary $a(t)$, and stress the importance of the role of the integrated acceleration $χ(t) = \\int^t dt'\\,a(t')$, which can also act as a temporal coordinate. We explore several non-trivial examples of $a(t)$ and their generalized Unruh temperatures. We additionally develop an approximation to the Unruh temperature for small deviations away from constant acceleration by the standard approach of considering the negative frequency content of a purely positive frequency plane wave of an inertial observer, as measured by the co-moving arbitrarily accelerated observer. Lastly, we develop and explicit coordinate transformation between the arbitrarily accelerated observer and conformal coordinates, where the plane wave structure of the solutions of the wave equation is readily transparent, and analogous to the form for the inertial observer."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau & Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota & Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\\rm Edd} \\gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \\gtrsim 6$."}

Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $μ$m and measure resolving powers ($E/δE$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $μ$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared."}

We focus particularly on asymmetric orbifolds, which are examples of non-geometric string compactifications and constitute an intriguing corner in the string landscape. We describe the orbifolds using two complementary approaches; the duality twists and the lattice approach. First, we discuss the general construction of freely acting (asymmetric) orbifolds, focusing on the closed string sector. Afterwards, we present explicit examples of orbifolds preserving $\\mathcal{N} = 6,4,2$ or $0$ supersymmetry in five dimensions and we demonstrate the connection between freely acting orbifolds and Scherk-Schwarz reductions by matching the lightest untwisted orbifold states with those arising form the effective supergravity theory. Regarding the orbifold twisted sectors, we show that at special points in the moduli space, generically massive states can become massless. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of non-supersymmetric orbifolds can become tachyon-free away from special loci in the moduli space. Next, we turn our attention to the orbifold moduli space, and we focus on orbifolds preserving $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetry in five dimensions, for which we determine the classical hypermultiplet and vector multiplet moduli spaces. Moreover, by constructing dual orbifold pairs, we argue that no quantum corrections to the metric on the vector multiplet moduli space arise. Then, we discuss aspects of the swampland program in the context of freely acting asymmetric orbifolds and we verify that the swampland distance conjecture is valid in the non-geometric compactifications of string theory studied in this thesis. Finally, we focus on the D-brane spectrum of freely acting orbifolds and we determine the conditions under which the various D-branes survive the orbifolding."}

Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs."}

While the $Λ$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings."}

We provide a public catalog of Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle for these galaxies in each of the filters. Uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated from simulated galaxies that have similar noise and background properties as the observed galaxies. We compare our measurements with those in the CANDELS/EGS field measured with HST/WFC3 and find that the sizes agree to within 0.09 dex and the Sérsic indices agree to within 0.13 dex. We further present the evolution in the size-mass relation, and find that the evolution to $z\\sim9$ is consistent with previous results derived at lower redshift. Finally, we look at the color gradients of galaxies at $1<z<5$ and find that for late-type galaxies ($n<2.5$), there is a strong dependence on mass, but no apparent evolution with redshift, indicating that the stellar populations and dust attenuation in more massive galaxies vary substantially with radius and contribute to significant morphological $k-$corrections. For early type galaxies ($n>2.5$), the color gradients are nearly flat with no dependence on mass, indicating that the stellar populations are more uniform throughout. The structural measurements presented are accurate to $20\\%$ or better for most galaxies with F356W $<27.0$ mag and will enable further studies of galaxy morphology to $z\\sim10$."}

The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'.

We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction."}

This approach leads to a systematic and robust quantification of parametric uncertainties in the models, especially in those challenging cases where different, possibly disjoint, regions of parameter space deliver similar results, which are usually not properly treated with current methodology.

Furthermore, we provide explicit top-down realizations in AdS/CFT setups in Type IIB string theory and M-theory, featuring Abelian as well as non-Abelian symmetries.

The analysis extends the previously considered WKB expansion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to modified gravity theories, up to second order. We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way."}

In this framework, the energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence of $H_0$. We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $α= 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $Λ$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension."}

In this paper, we analyze the properties and dynamics of filaments in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from Zhao et al. 2024. Using filament and superbubble structure analysis codes, we investigate the roles of galactic shear, supernovae and superbubbles, and magnetic fields on the stability and fragmentation of filaments. We find that local shear has little effect on filament stability and the largest structures at outer radii of the disk may be more likely to be dissipated by shear than supernovae. Filaments are largely parallel to the magnetic field, which plays a significant role in filament stability. By measuring the ratio of surface pressure on a filament to that on its central spine, $χ_f=P_{surf}/P_{central}$, we find that filaments with $χ_f \\le 1$ are dominated by their own self gravity and have a strong tendency to be gravitationally supercritical, whereas those with $χ_f > 1$ are either transitory or in the act of being formed. Finally, we investigate the role of ISM pressure on filament dynamics and stability as a function of galactic radius, finding considerable changes in filament stability and the accompanying star formation rates in the inner versus outer regions of the disk."}

While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.\n  The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.\n  Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives."}

We forecast improvements in axion constraints from the void size function (VSF; the void number density as function of their radius). A \\textit{Euclid}-like survey (effective volume of $73\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ with a prior on the other $Λ$CDM cosmological parameters from the Simons Observatory cosmic microwave background experiment) can limit the axion energy density (for $m_\\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) to $< 4.6\\%$ of the DM (at $95\\%$ credibility), about two times stronger than current limits. Conversely, we show that a Universe with a dark sector consisting of axions at the $10\\%$ level, as motivated by the string axiverse, can be recovered with $\\sim 2 σ$ preference. A DESI-like survey achieves comparable results. Axion and $Λ$CDM parameters have different degeneracies given VSF and galaxy power spectrum data, indicating future combined analyses will be most powerful in disentangling the DM nature. We anticipate our results will extend to other (e.g., warm or interacting) DM models."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "The chemical abundances of a stellar population encode information about nucleosynthesis and its astrophysical sites, but this information is confounded by the specific star formation history of the host galaxy. As a result, placing empirical constraints on supernova yields and timing using abundances has been very challenging. We introduce a galactic chemical evolution model DLEIY that uses an observed star formation history and metallicity distribution to reduce these confounding factors. Using a joint statistical model of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, simultaneous constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows are achieved with DLEIY, without fixing the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields. The Fe yield from core collapse supernovae is consistent with existing theoretical yield models, while the measured Mg yield is a factor of 2-4 higher, corroborating previous suggestions that yield models may under-predict [Mg/Fe]. We also find that the rate of Type Ia supernovae is enhanced by about a factor of 5 relative to field galaxies, and the delay-time distribution goes as $\\sim t^{-2}$, a much steeper relationship than that measured from supernova surveys ($\\sim t^{-1.1}$). These findings may suggest a metallicity dependence of the Type Ia rate and delay-time distribution."}

At the level of effective wave equations this principle manifests itself through deformed dispersion relations and energy-dependent spatial operators. Here we quantify such effects in a prototypical exactly solvable bound-state problem: the three-dimensional Klein--Gordon oscillator generated by a non-minimal momentum coupling that yields isotropic harmonic confinement while preserving rotational symmetry. We analyze two standard DSR realizations (Amelino--Camelia and Magueijo--Smolin, parametrized by an invariant energy scale $k$) as well as a generalized DSR framework based on a first-order expansion in the Planck length $l_p$. After stationary reduction and separation in spherical coordinates, the eigenfunctions retain the generalized-Laguerre and spherical-harmonic structure of the undeformed oscillator, whereas DSR deforms the algebraic quantization condition that relates the principal oscillator number $N=2n+\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}_0$ to the relativistic energy.

We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\\sim10\\,\\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties -- such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass -- mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses."}

The CO$_2$ gas-to-ice ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than in young stellar objects, pointing to distinct ice formation or processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments.

Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $σ_{\\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\\rm out} = 2.6\\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \\lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST."}

To interpret such a detection, robust theoretical models are essential. The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism."}

Starting from the pseudo-Lagrangian, we construct parent actions for all higher gradient dual fields that are associated with the three-form, the six-form, and the dual graviton. We show that the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations constrain the Stueckelberg fields to be pure curls, ensuring that the higher duals propagate the same physical degrees of freedom as the original supergravity fields. The additional Stueckelberg fields, which are not predicted by the tensor hierarchy algebra, are shown to play a specific role as sources for the Labastida tensors of the higher dual fields."}

Using the European LOFAR (ILT) at 145 MHz, we study a radio relic at (sub-)arcsecond resolution for the first time below 1 GHz, complemented by arcsecond-resolution VLA data at higher frequencies. We confirm the diffuse emission is not a radio galaxy. A spectral index gradient toward the cluster center matches previous 5'' maps. High-resolution 0.4'' and 1.9'' images reveal emission ahead of the shock, connecting the relic to a radio galaxy. 1.9'' profiles across the downstream at 145 MHz and 3.0 GHz follow a log-normal magnetic field distribution. The 145 MHz shock surface shows a sharp discontinuity at the same location of a change in electron density, Rotation Measure, and fractional polarization, likely tied to magnetic field changes. Finally, we find hints of redshift evolution of the radio power versus cluster mass correlation. The impressive angular resolution achievable by the LOFAR long baselines is opening an unprecedented view of the low energetic plasma in galaxy clusters. This is extremely significant in the case of high-redshift clusters, where radio emission at low frequencies is less affected by energy losses but its detection is strongly limited by poor resolution."}

We welcome your thoughts and feedback!", "summary": "The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods."}

This construction provides an intrinsic eleven-dimensional carrier for modular data and admits a canonical tilting and comparison procedure that yields elliptic geometry as an output rather than an auxiliary input. Using this framework, we establish a precise M-theory/Type IIB dictionary in the constant-coupling sector, showing how the physical axio-dilaton is fixed by eleven-dimensional geometric and topological data. The correspondence is tested at the level of the ten-dimensional bosonic effective action, including its topological couplings inherited from eleven dimensions. The tower-completed geometry naturally organizes global sectors in generalized cohomology, with charge data governed by K-theory and exhibiting a canonical prime-power torsion structure. We further show how this framework extends to varying-coupling backgrounds and duality defects, admits a natural adelic completion with prime-independence, and generalizes to higher-rank and U-duality geometries. We also discuss holographic aspects and the anomaly-refined extension of the duality group beyond the bosonic truncation. Together, these results provide a coherent, non-singular foundation for F-theory and its extensions."}

To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields."}

However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields."}

Comparing fits with and without FIR constraints, we find that for the 3.2$\\%$ of galaxies with $>3 σ$ detections in at least two Herschel bands, UV-MIR-only models (0.3-24$μ$m) recover robust stellar ages, SFRs, and stellar masses (50-70$\\%$ within the median 1$σ$ error). Consequently, the star-forming sequence shows no systematic offset, with an average deviation of 0.1$\\pm$0.07 dex at fixed stellar mass for FIR-detected sources at all redshifts. However, the use of rigid log-average IR templates with fixed dust emission parameters ($γ$, $U_{\\mathrm{min}}$, $Q_{\\mathrm{PAH}}$) in UV-MIR modeling corresponds to an unevolving MIR-to-IR luminosity ratio and cold dust temperatures.

This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks."}

We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous \"cocoon\". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission."}

Starting from the nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model, we explicitly construct its classical mapping to the $CP^1$ formulation, emphasizing the emergence of a local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry intrinsically linked to the Fubini-Study target-space geometry. Focusing on the static sector, we analyze magnetized BPS lump configurations. By examining the topological boundary conditions, we show that the magnetic flux is quantized and fully determined by the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field. Within the BPS framework, we identify the specific self-interaction potential required for the existence of self-dual configurations. A detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior, both near the lump core and at spatial infinity, demonstrates that finite-energy solutions necessarily correspond to lump-like BPS configurations in the $CP^1$ target space, with the scalar field vanishing asymptotically. The resulting BPS equations are solved numerically, and the main physical properties of the solutions are presented. We find that these configurations are regular, magnetically localized, and energetically stable, with their internal structure rigidly controlled by the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space. In contrast to Abelian Higgs vortices, the configurations discussed here do not rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking but arise purely from the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space."}

The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism."}

When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase.

Baryogenesis occurs via non-thermal leptogenesis which is also realized by the inflaton's decay to the lightest and/or next-to-lightest right-handed neutrinos for normal ordered light neutrino masses."}

Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas."}

We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $α= 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $Λ$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension."}

The basic fields are formulated in terms of two-component spin-tensors in (A)dS space where the tracelessness conditions are automatically fulfilled. The mass shell of partially massless fields is reformulated in terms of constraints on Fock space vectors including the second-class constraints. A conversion procedure for transforming second-class constraints into first-class ones is developed, allowing one to construct a Hermitian and nilpotent BRST charge in the Fock space under consideration. It is proven that the hermiticity and nilpotency restrict the conditions on the theory parameters, which are fulfilled only in dS space. The hermiticity of the BRST charge is incompatible with AdS space. The gauge invariant Lagrangian is constructed on the basis of the BRST charge, and for spin $s$ and depth $t$ the allowed states in the Lagrangian include only $(s-t)$ Stückelberg fields. Their exclusion leads to gauge transformations of degree $(s-t)$ for the physical fields. The Lagrangian equations of motion exactly reproduce the mass shell conditions. The Lagrangian in terms of conventional spin-tensor fields is also presented."}

Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $σ_{\\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\\rm out} = 2.6\\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \\lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution.

The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, with 1.5arcsec resolution, has enabled the characterization of recently formed (up to 300 Myr) SFCs on tens of parsec scales in nearby galaxies. The spatial distribution of SFCs with different ages can provide insights into the hierarchy of star formation. This study presents a semi-novel approach to characterize SFCs in two nearby spiral galaxies, NGC 5457 and NGC 1313, by combining UVIT FUV data with g-band data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). We tested and optimized our method on NGC 5457 and showed that after proper background subtraction, the FUV-g color of SFCs can serve as an equally reliable age indicator as the widely-used FUV-NUV color. Next, we parametrized the star formation hierarchy in NGC 5457 using the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and found good agreement between the hierarchy parameters derived using FUV-NUV and FUV-g based ages. Using our FUV-g based SFC ages, we also constrained the global hierarchy parameter of NGC 1313 for the first time. The development of our FUV-g based method is motivated by the fact that the NUV channel of the UVIT is not operational, and there is a wealth of archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. This work demonstrates the potential of our method in constraining the SFC ages and investigating hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using FUV and optical observations."}

We present a time-resolved, per galaxy analysis of SMBH mass assembly that explicitly tracks bar formation, merger events, and the environment along the main progenitor branches using the high resolution IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We analyze barred and unbarred disc galaxies in isolated and non-isolated environments using physically motivated boundary definitions. We found that SMBH fueling pathways are regulated by the environment through the timing of bar formation relative to mergers. In isolated barred galaxies, stellar bars form early in dynamically cold discs and establish sustained, coherent accretion phases that regulate late-time SMBH growth. In contrast, in non-isolated galaxies, SMBH growth is dominated by early merger-driven accretion episodes, whereas bars form later and contribute weakly to the primary growth phase. Unbarred control samples show that mergers can trigger rapid SMBH growth without bars, but such growth remains episodic, whereas isolated discs without bars lack sustained accretion. These results demonstrate an environmental bifurcation in SMBH fueling: mergers act as efficient triggers of early growth in dynamically active systems, while bars regulate prolonged accretion only when they form in quiescent discs. This study provides a unified time-domain framework linking galaxy environment, disc dynamics, and SMBH growth by resolving the temporal ordering of bars, mergers, and accretion."}

Utilising deep optical imaging from DESI-LS and spectroscopic data from DESI and P200, we employ 2D morphological decomposition using \\textsc{GALIGHT} alongside joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with \\textsc{BAGPIPES} and \\textsc{CIGALE} to deconstruct the structural properties and star formation histories of the member galaxies. Crucially, we identify an asymmetric tidal tail extending $\\sim$15.15 kpc from Component A, confirming the ongoing interaction between the companions. Although Component C appears quiescent in both morphology and spectroscopy, we reveal a subtle robust signal of ``minor rejuvenation'', characterised by significant internal dust extinction of $E(B-V) \\sim 0.53$ and a UV excess. The reconstructed star formation history indicates a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr) starburst that contributes a negligible fraction to the total stellar mass ($f_{\\rm burst} < 0.1$ per cent). We propose that this activity is fueled by the accretion of metal-enriched gas stripped from the interacting companions.

Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas."}

Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs."}

Starting from the nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model, we explicitly construct its classical mapping to the $CP^1$ formulation, emphasizing the emergence of a local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry intrinsically linked to the Fubini-Study target-space geometry. Focusing on the static sector, we analyze magnetized BPS lump configurations. By examining the topological boundary conditions, we show that the magnetic flux is quantized and fully determined by the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field. Within the BPS framework, we identify the specific self-interaction potential required for the existence of self-dual configurations. A detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior, both near the lump core and at spatial infinity, demonstrates that finite-energy solutions necessarily correspond to lump-like BPS configurations in the $CP^1$ target space, with the scalar field vanishing asymptotically. The resulting BPS equations are solved numerically, and the main physical properties of the solutions are presented. We find that these configurations are regular, magnetically localized, and energetically stable, with their internal structure rigidly controlled by the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space. In contrast to Abelian Higgs vortices, the configurations discussed here do not rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking but arise purely from the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space."}

We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way."}

Construction of self-consistent models rather than populations that are confined by an external potential leads to the conclusion that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations.

This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5<z<7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for ``Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources.

We further explore how the jet-driven explosions create the diversity of models which could be compatible with the observed diversity in terms of $^{56}$Ni-mass vs ejecta mass, Ti-V relation, and stellar abundances. Finally, we apply the new collapsar models in the Galactic Chemical Evolution context. We study how the galactic stars, including the Zn-enriched star HE 1327-2326, can put constraints on the relative rates of collapsar and some of its model parameters. We show that collapsar could lead to significant changes in some elements, e.g., Zn.

An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks."}

We establish a universal entropy--extremality relation that provides thermodynamic evidence for the WGC independently of $f_{R_0}$ and $R_0$. Photon sphere analysis from both geodesic and topological perspectives confirms the simultaneous compatibility of the WGC and WCCC, with the Euler--Heisenberg coupling restoring photon spheres in the naked singularity regime. Gravitational lensing in the strong- and weak-deflection limits reveals that the photon sphere radius is independent of the cosmological background while the critical impact parameter nearly doubles in de Sitter. Black hole shadow images under isotropic accretion are constructed. Within the Barrow entropy framework, we uncover van der Waals-type phase transitions and analyze Joule-Thomson expansion, identifying the small black hole phase as the WGC-compatible thermodynamic regime accessible via isenthalpic cooling."}

In particular, while adiabatic growth of the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^\\ast$ at the Galactic Center (GC) can induce a 'spike' in central DM density, the existence of such a spike is still under debate. Here we present new constraints on the spike slope $γ_{\\rm sp}$ using conventional DM indirect detection searches. We first recast existing photon and neutrino line searches, which include the contribution from the GC region, into constraints on the thermally-averaged DM annihilation cross section $\\langleσv\\rangle$ in the presence of a DM spike. We then derive new bounds on the spike profile for a generic Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) DM scenario, where the thermal freeze-out mechanism fixes the annihilation cross-section at $\\langleσv\\rangle\\sim (2-3) \\times 10^{-26}~{\\rm cm}^3~{\\rm s}^{-1}$. We find that for DM annihilation to photons, constraints from Fermi-LAT and MAGIC rule out spike profiles at the GC for a broad range of WIMP DM masses from 10 GeV to 100 TeV. Our result holds even if the photon channel constitutes only $1\\%$ of the total annihilation rate. For the neutrino channel, we use the IceCube data to constrain the existence of an extremely steep spike in the $\\mathscr{O}(1-10)$ TeV DM mass range. Our analysis can be easily extended to other annihilation channels."}

To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields."}

Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model."}
