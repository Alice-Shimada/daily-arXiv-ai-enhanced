TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的含尘非理想磁流体动力学模型，揭示了在湍流致密星际介质中，带电尘埃可通过类似参量不稳定性机制在激波区域形成高密度团块，显著促进尘埃增长。

Motivation: 尘埃在恒星形成区会显著增长，传统上假设尘埃占气体质量的1%，但在小尺度上尘埃与气体的动力学差异可能导致局部富集，从而增强凝结速率。研究旨在探究湍流磁化环境中带电尘埃的团聚机制。

Method: 发展了一种超越标准非理想MHD的多流体模型，使用shark代码进行一维数值模拟，考虑单一粒径带电尘埃与中性气体的相互作用，并包含大尺度驱动湍流及离子-中性摩擦效应。

Result: 发现一种类似参量不稳定的机制可高效形成尘埃团块，即使存在耗散过程仍能维持；高横向-纵向磁比（由横向马赫数和等离子体参数控制）有利于尘埃密度增强；在合理条件下，大量尘埃密度可增加十倍以上，主要发生在激波区域的压缩性磁效应下。

Conclusion: 新模型表明，在湍流环境下，带电尘埃作为主要电荷载体，受激波区参量不稳定类机制驱动的压缩性磁场作用，可实现远超纯流体力学过程的高密度聚集，使得原恒星包层内原位形成亚毫米级大颗粒尘埃成为可能。

Abstract: Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments,
especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is
generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations
are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading
to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to
investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense
regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes
beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform
multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas
with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results:
We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently
forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong
clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high
levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects
in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high
transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse
Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust
experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable
conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal
MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to
small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability -
like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density
enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure
hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in
protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.
