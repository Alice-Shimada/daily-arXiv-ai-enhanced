Our goal\nis to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to\n2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger\nastrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys --\nincluding the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added\nspectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the\nsample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all\nambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered\n20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and\nmid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of\nphotometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The\nresulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances\nunder 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\\% of the sample and ellipse\nfits for 80\\%. REGALADE is more than 90\\% complete for massive galaxies out to\n360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\\% more known supernova hosts, doubles\nthe number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable\nhosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources.

The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be\nhighly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g.,\nbispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for\na varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many\ntimes, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge,\nmany artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced,\nwhich produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN\nemulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus,\nthey fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions.\nTherefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline,\nthey cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated\nmodel parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural\nnetwork (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the\nposterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their\nprediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference\npipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock\nobservation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW\nobservation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty\nfor the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the\ninference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced\nthe training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN\noutperforms the ANN emulators.

As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant\ntargets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science\ngoals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the\nsimultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the\nfield of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000\nindividually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.\n  The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce\nunwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting\nvaluable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the\naffected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to\nprevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces\nNIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of\nmasking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.\n  More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical\nprocedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This\nexperience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected\nrows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of\nmultiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.\n  As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable\nWorlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain\nrelevant beyond JWST.

H-atom exposure of toluene\nleads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane\n($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for\nIMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how\nGW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore\nthe impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function\n(IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN\ndynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for\nGW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS,\nwe demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the\nAGN channel. We also postulate that the masses and spin magnitudes of GW231123\nare most consistent with a merger of fourth and third generation BHs, for most\nchoices of a segregated BH IMF and AGN lifetime."}

Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder\nour ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have\ninstrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear\nfollowing detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their\norigins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse\nplatform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new\nglitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the\ndetectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for\nmachine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse\nempowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring\nchanges in data quality in the LIGO detectors."}

Since this operation can model the quasiperiodic\noscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the surrounding accretion disc, we then employ\nthe MCMC simulation to fit the theoretical results with three QPO events,\nincluding GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226 and H1743-322, and constrain the\ncharacteristic radius $r$, black hole mass $M$ and spinning parameter $a$, and\nthe Horndeski hair parameter $h$. Our constraint on the Horndeski hair\nparameter is much tighter than QPOs simulation from the existed accretion\nmodels, suggesting slight deviation from classical Kerr black hole."}

We study a cloud of\ntwo-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD,\nfreely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a\nweak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an\nemergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics\n(CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission\nprocess. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D\n= 1/(\\pi\\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces\nthe entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that\nthe causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological\nthermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global\ncausal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom,\nhighlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to\nthe existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole."}
