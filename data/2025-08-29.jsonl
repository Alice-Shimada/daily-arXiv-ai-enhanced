In the present work, we relate this\nproperty to the physical mass gap of QCD by considering two observables\nassociated with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, namely the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition temperature and the pion decay constant,\nrespectively. It turns out that the first observable is linearly proportional\nto the gluon mass gap, a fact that allows us to assign a direct physical\nmeaning to this scale. Moreover, we identify three distinct momentum regimes in\nthe gluon propagator, ultraviolet, intermediate, and deep infrared, and assess\ntheir impact on the aforementioned observables. Both observables are sensitive\nto the first two regions of momenta, where functional approaches essentially\ncoincide, but are insensitive to the third, deep infrared, regime. The combined\ninformation is used for a simple fit for the gluon propagator, all of whose\nparameters admit a clear physical interpretation.

However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has\nno closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally\nexpensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to\nmimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile\nfitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and\ndemonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and\n$k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated\ntransforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an\nequation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be\nbased on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We\nimplement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and\nensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model\ngalaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of\ngalaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering\ntechnique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5\ntimes faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy.

Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types\nof planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from\nlow-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational\nand theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and\nnature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission\nassociated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of\nunderstanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies\nindicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their\nhost PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures.\nThe detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the\nobservations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with\nalready known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and\nSpectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band\nfilter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\\mu}$m emission line, was used along with\na continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a\ndeep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey\nof five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in\nthe H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\\mu}$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe.\nThese findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron\ndensity in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is\nlinked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first\nestimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between\n200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass."}

We thus coined these processes superradiant interactions. In\nthis paper, we propose a protocol to realize this enhancement and boost the\ndiscovery potential for such relics. We show how concepts from quantum optics\ncan be adapted to nuclear spins coupled to superconducting circuits, enabling\nhigh-sensitivity systems. The spins are first initialized into a coherent spin\nstate via a $\\pi/2$ Rabi pulse from the ground state. When the circuit is\nsufficiently detuned from resonance, the spin-circuit interaction implements a\nsqueezing Hamiltonian. Because squeezing must outpace spin relaxation and\ndephasing, the protocol favors macroscopic ensembles and high-quality\nsuperconducting circuits. During this squeezing phase, the standard quantum\nvariance is reduced by up to 4.8 orders of magnitude-equivalent to 48 dB of\nsqueezing-for circuits with quality factors $Q \\sim 10^8$-$10^9$. The signal\nimprinted on the spins during the squeezing protocol can be magnified by\nfurther utilizing the squeezing interactions, easing the requirement for\nshot-noise-limited readout. This protocol has the potential to significantly\naccelerate axion and dark photon dark matter searches and extend the reach of\nexisting axion experiments to probe QCD axion-nuclear spin couplings.

The new\ndata have sufficient angular resolution to exclude compact sources and enable\nus to trace the faint extended emission from the relic lobe to a remarkable\ndistance of 820 kpc from the cluster center. The new images reveal intricate\nspatial structure within the fossil lobe, including narrow (5-10 kpc), long\n(70-100 kpc) radio filaments embedded within the diffuse emission at the bottom\nof the lobe. The filaments exhibit a very steep spectrum ($S_\\nu\\propto\n\\nu^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\sim 3$), significantly steeper than the ambient\nsynchrotron emission from the lobe ($\\alpha \\sim 1.5-2$); they mostly disappear\nin recently-published MeerKAT images at 1.28 GHz. Their origin is unclear;\nsimilar features observed in some other radio lobes typically have a spectrum\nflatter than that of their ambient medium. These radio filaments may trace\nregions where the magnetic field has been stretched and amplified by gas\ncirculation within the rising bubble. The spectrum of the brightest region of\nthe radio lobe exhibits a spectral break, which corresponds to a radiative\ncooling age of the fossil lobe of approximately 174 Myr, giving a date for this\nmost powerful AGN explosion."}

In the present work, we relate this\nproperty to the physical mass gap of QCD by considering two observables\nassociated with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, namely the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition temperature and the pion decay constant,\nrespectively. It turns out that the first observable is linearly proportional\nto the gluon mass gap, a fact that allows us to assign a direct physical\nmeaning to this scale. Moreover, we identify three distinct momentum regimes in\nthe gluon propagator, ultraviolet, intermediate, and deep infrared, and assess\ntheir impact on the aforementioned observables. Both observables are sensitive\nto the first two regions of momenta, where functional approaches essentially\ncoincide, but are insensitive to the third, deep infrared, regime. The combined\ninformation is used for a simple fit for the gluon propagator, all of whose\nparameters admit a clear physical interpretation. Finally, we discuss how this\nfit can help us access the intertwined dynamics of confinement and chiral\nsymmetry breaking in QCD-type theories."}

Although initial results indicated this scenario as\nnonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density,\nrecent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not\nalways be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field\nequations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central\npremise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the\nmore common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for\ngenerating superluminal velocities, or \\textit{warp speeds}, through a warped\nregion in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources:\ndust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures,\ncharged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.\n  A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described\nby a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation\npurely dependent on time is also shown.

This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of\ndark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain\nthe inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity\nmoments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree\nmodels from de Bruijne et al.

The data from the\nEvent Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter\nranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum\ncorrection of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole\nshadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of\nmagnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated\nintensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the\nspherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion\ndisk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and\nthe contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition,\nthe photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are\nnarrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider.

To tackle this issue for TianQin\nwhich has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment\nstrategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the\ntransmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated\nthrough a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding\nintensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value\ncompensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the\nproposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad\nfrom the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length\ncoupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement\ngiven a transmitted beam aberration of $\\lambda/40$ RMS."}

However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has\nno closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally\nexpensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to\nmimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile\nfitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and\ndemonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and\n$k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated\ntransforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an\nequation which approximates its behavior.

We\nimplement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and\nensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model\ngalaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of\ngalaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering\ntechnique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5\ntimes faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy.

We investigate its physical\nconsequences via the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector along static,\ninertial, and uniformly accelerated trajectories.

To avoid negative potentials, an\nadditional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired\ninteraction.

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x\nsensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting\nnon-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise\nsources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with\npopulation models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we\nfind our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are\napproaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference\nresults and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background\narising from compact binary coalescences is $\\Omega_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm\nHz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest\ncontribution is due to binary black holes only, $\\Omega_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm\nHz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$."}

From a phenomenological point of view, this\nmakes direct probing of the associated new resonances, such as the X and Y\nbosons, out of reach for even the most optimistic future experiments. It has,\nhowever, been known that certain specific patterns of baryon and lepton number\nviolation can suppress proton decay by multiple powers of the masses of the\nheavy resonances involved, opening the possibility that the observed limits on\nthe proton lifetime are consistent with baryon number violating physics at\nenergy scales much lower than that of grand unification.

In the present work, we relate this\nproperty to the physical mass gap of QCD by considering two observables\nassociated with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, namely the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition temperature and the pion decay constant,\nrespectively. It turns out that the first observable is linearly proportional\nto the gluon mass gap, a fact that allows us to assign a direct physical\nmeaning to this scale. Moreover, we identify three distinct momentum regimes in\nthe gluon propagator, ultraviolet, intermediate, and deep infrared, and assess\ntheir impact on the aforementioned observables. Both observables are sensitive\nto the first two regions of momenta, where functional approaches essentially\ncoincide, but are insensitive to the third, deep infrared, regime. The combined\ninformation is used for a simple fit for the gluon propagator, all of whose\nparameters admit a clear physical interpretation. Finally, we discuss how this\nfit can help us access the intertwined dynamics of confinement and chiral\nsymmetry breaking in QCD-type theories."}

This catalog yields the first\nradially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild\noblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$\nbeyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in\nthis series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to\ninfer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy\ndue to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical\nsymmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of\ndark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain\nthe inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity\nmoments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree\nmodels from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on)\nconfigurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons\n($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark\nmatter density slope of $\\Gamma_{\\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the\nradial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\\Gamma_{\\rm\ndark} \\leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower\ninclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The\nresults qualitatively agree with $\\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios\nthat predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide\nquantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or\nparticle masses required by these models, respectively."}

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results.

The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time.

While most studies assume idealized vacuum\nbackgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in\nastrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark\nmatter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital\ndynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions\ndescribing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time,\nand map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of\nvacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a\nCarter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of\nchaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations\naround transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise\ncompletely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are\nextended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit\npoints. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant\npoint is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing\nthe lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can\nsubject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant\nconsequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of\nastrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals."}

Using the WKB method, direct integration, and Bernstein\nspectral techniques, we compute quasinormal frequencies across different\nparameter regimes, addressing both single and double-barrier effective\npotentials. Time-domain evolution of wave packets reveals clear echo signals\nfor split brane configurations ($s > 1, \\delta > 1$), produced by successive\nreflections between sub-branes.

These under-sampled\nareas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more\nrepresentative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this\nSOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of\nSpace and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the\nOpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the\nexpected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of\nobservation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours,\nmagnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the\ncompilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the\ndegraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2\ncatalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift\nestimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for\nhigh-redshift galaxies ($z_\\mathrm{true} \\gtrsim 1.5$).

The common strategy to solve the problem is to\nimpose a shift symmetry on the K\\\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a\nnegative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an\nadditional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired\ninteraction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a\nstabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a\nsingle chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field\ncomponents.

In this paper, we\npresent numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in\nMinkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We\nnumerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite\ndifference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid\nstructure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We\npresent three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of\nequilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy\ndensity, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case\nwith sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though\ninitialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the\nregime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in\nthe solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This\nbehavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs\nat much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D\nconformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities\nin solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial\ndata.

The work concludes by comparing the\nfits of the $f(T)$ gravity model to the $\\Lambda$CDM model using various\ninformation criteria, revealing key insights into the viability of modified\ngravity in contemporary cosmology."}

In particular, we consider a higher-dimension operator\ncoupling the Kretschmann scalar to a baryon-number-violating current which\ngenerates an effective chemical potential at the black hole horizon and leads\nto asymmetric Hawking radiation. Relative to earlier studies, we account for\nentropy dilution from evaporation, incorporate chemical potential dependent\ngreybody factors and numerically track the fully coupled evolution of a PBH\npopulation in an expanding universe. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry\ncan be reproduced within a viable region of parameter space for several PBH\nmass spectra including log-normal, critical-collapse, and power-law\ndistributions."}

The common strategy to solve the problem is to\nimpose a shift symmetry on the K\\\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a\nnegative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an\nadditional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired\ninteraction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a\nstabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a\nsingle chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field\ncomponents. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to\nmulti-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for\nembedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into\nsupergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of\nmulti-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic\ninstabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens\nthe theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity."}
