On the one\nhand, they are fundamental objects to conduct precision phenomenology studies,\ne.g. at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), to determine the Standard Model\nparameters and search for new physics. On the other hand, they are also a means\nto understand the inner structure and dynamics of hadrons, e.g. in regards to\nthe proton spin decomposition at the future Electron Ion Collider (EIC). This\nthesis presents advancements in PDF and FF determinations contributing to\nupcoming releases by the NNPDF collaboration. For PDFs, three topics are\naddressed: (i) assessing the K-factor approximation versus exact NNLO\ncalculations; (ii) evaluating the compatibility of new data with existing PDFs,\naccounting for all relevant theoretical and experimental uncertainties; and\n(iii) studying the impact of new data, with focus on processes sensitive to the\ngluon PDF: single-inclusive jet and di-jet production in proton-proton\ncollisions and deep-inelastic scattering, and top-quark pair production in\nproton-proton collisions. For FFs, I extend the NNPDF framework through: (i)\nimplementation of time-like evolution in EKO; (ii) extension of PineAPPL to\nhandle multiple convolutions of PDFs and FFs, including the corresponding\nfactorization scales and the polarization of the initial and final states; and\n(iii) development of a new code, vhf, for computing SIA and SIDIS cross\nsections. All of these developments are crucial to prepare the release of\nnext-gen PDF and FF sets that will allow us to take advantage of the\nforthcoming LHC and EIC physics programs as much as possible."}

We\nimplement the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos, which can be considered\nas a benchmark within this class of models, in the SARAH package. The scalar\nsector is constructed from the most general potential involving three Higgs\ntriplets and one scalar sextet, consistent with the required symmetries for a\nrealistic model. The neutrino sector is also analyzed in some detail, where\nleft- and right-handed neutrinos reside in the same leptonic multiplet.\nNeutrino masses are generated via the Type-I seesaw mechanism, and the Yukawa\ncouplings were constrained employing the Casas-Ibarra parametrization.

While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS\ntwo-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact\npersists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large\nnumber of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in\nordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a\nnecessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of\nblack holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement\nnegativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more\ngeneral non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative\ncontributions to the gravitational path integral.

The interplay between these processes determines the star formation\nrate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a\nnumerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and\nevolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical\ncode FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical\nMultipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from\nionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until\nnow, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of\nprotostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free\nparameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation\nsimulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar\njets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \\times 10^4$\nM$_{\\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds\n(M $= 5 \\times 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of\nprotostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and\ninjection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find\nthat the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the\ngas at early times.

A key\nfinding is that charge parity forces the twist-3 $2\\pi$DAs to be asymmetric in\nthe momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark.

This agrees with the impact of GC environment on the lifetime of\nhard binaries: (MSS+HeWD) systems merge there soon after arising from (MSS+MSS)\nbinaries that underwent the common-envelope stage of evolution.

Multi-band data from the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array (VLA) reveal how low-power jets interact with their\nenvironment. These interactions can slow down and disrupt the radio outflows\nwhile locally regulating star formation through AGN feedback. Several radio\nproperties correlate strongly with the black hole mass, similar to trends\nobserved in radio-loud (RL) AGN. Although their characteristics differ, RQ\nsystems might not be intrinsically distinct from RL AGN, apart from lower jet\npowers. Our polarization measurements further suggest a composite model in\nwhich a black hole-accretion disk system drives both a collimated jet with a\nsmall-pitch-angle helical B-field and a wide-angle wind threaded by a\nhigh-pitch-angle helical field."}

Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in\nordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a\nnecessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of\nblack holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement\nnegativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more\ngeneral non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative\ncontributions to the gravitational path integral.

The physical\norigin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation:\na scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams\nassociated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars\nform at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated\ngas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks\ncan form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of\nhalo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of\nstar formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of\nhigh-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future\nobservations."}

Characterizing multiple stellar populations and chemical abundances in the bulge globular cluster NGC 6569", "comment": null, "summary": "Context. The CAPOS project aims to obtain accurate mean abundances and radial\nvelocities for many elements, and it explores the multiple population (MP)\nphenomenon in Galactic bulge globular clusters (BGCs). NGC 6569 is one of the\nCAPOS targets. Aims. This study provides a detailed high-resolution\nspectroscopic analysis of NGC 6569 to derive precise abundances for elements of\ndifferent nucleosynthetic origins and to unveil its MPs by focusing on key\nspectral features. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of 11\ngiant members with the BACCHUS code, deriving abundances for 12 elements (C, N,\nO, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Al, Ce, Nd). Isochrone fitting with Gaia+2MASS\nphotometry was used to estimate atmospheric parameters, cluster distance, and\nextinction. Results. We obtained [Fe/H] = -0.91 $\\pm$ 0.06, consistent with\nAPOGEE pipeline values; the scatter lies within uncertainties. The cluster\nshows [$\\alpha$/Fe] = 0.36 $\\pm$ 0.06 dex, similar to other GCs. Al appears\nhomogeneous, while N is strongly enriched ([N/Fe] = 0.68 $\\pm$ 0.34) with a\nspread of 0.90 dex, yielding two populations anticorrelated in C. The n-capture\nelements Ce and Nd are overabundant compared to the Sun but consistent with GCs\nof similar metallicity, with $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ = -0.17 $\\pm$ 0.12. We\nalso measure RV = -49.75 $\\pm$ 3.68 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous\nworks, while d$_\\odot$ = 12.4 $\\pm$ 1.45 kpc and E(B-V) = 0.68 are both higher\nthan literature values. Conclusions. MPs in NGC 6569 are confirmed through a\nclear C-N anticorrelation. The cluster shows [$\\alpha$/Fe] enhancement from\nType II SNe and no Mg-Al-Si anticorrelation, suggesting rapid and homogeneous\nformation. The $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ ratio points to contributions from\nr-process events such as neutron star mergers, while overall Ce and Nd\nabundances are reported here for the first time in this cluster."}

We confirm that there are two\nplasma components in both nebulae: a normal nebular plasma that emits both\nforbidden and permitted lines and an additional plasma component that emits the\npermitted lines of O I, C II, N II, O II, and Ne II. These plasma components\nhave different spatial distributions, with the additional plasma component\nbeing the more centrally concentrated.

The theory admits\na scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary\nscalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor\ntheory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the\nRicci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a\nradial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field\nequations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As\ncompared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution\ncontains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate,\nrespectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and\nobtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole\nat the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general\nrelativity (gravitational redshift, the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s parameter and the\nuniversality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion\nprecession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo\ndelay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole\nsolution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be\nfully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl\ngeometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic\ntests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution."}

We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting\n(metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana\nneutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale\nassociated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable\ngravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon\nasymmetry via leptogenesis.
