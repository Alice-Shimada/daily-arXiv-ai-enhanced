This exploratory calculation is performed using a leading-order pionless effective field theory of two nucleons in a finite 3D spatial volume, where the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly for moderate volumes. By considering a range of couplings where the theory supports a deuteron-like bound state, we determine the finite-volume spectra and matrix elements of the conserved local vector current. Using the Lüscher formalism, we constrain the infinite-volume, purely hadronic amplitude for this theory. Using previously derived formalism, we then map the finite-volume matrix elements to scattering amplitudes describing a reaction coupling two-particle states via a current insertion, $\\2+\\Jc \\to \\2$. We then use a recently derived relation between this class of amplitudes and the bound-state elastic form factor to directly constrain the infinite-volume form factor. By varying over a range of values of the coupling of the theory, we explore the effects of this analysis for deep-bound states and shallow-bound states. We reproduce the expected result that for deep bound states, the finite-volume formalism is largely unnecessary, while for shallow bound states, it is absolutely critical to obtain a sensible result. We present a detailed outline of the analysis of this class of matrix elements, including the determination of the charge radius of the bound state. In the shallow bound state limit, we find good agreement with the prediction stemming from the anomalous threshold."}

In practice, this means that once the action evaluation routine is implemented, the corresponding HMC force can be generated automatically from the same code path, without deriving or maintaining a separate force routine. The method preserves conventional imperative, in-place implementations and enables a single-source workflow in which forces are generated directly from the action code while inheriting compiler optimizations. We perform end-to-end reverse-mode differentiation of both gauge and Wilson fermion actions. For the Wilson fermion case, we find that the force generated by automatic differentiation achieves performance comparable to a conventional hand-written fermion force implementation. The same differentiation pipeline targets both CPU and GPU backends, providing a practical route to performance-portable force construction for compositional lattice actions."}

To accurately determine its finite-volume spectrum, a variational analysis using a large basis of operators, including bilocal scattering operators, but also local tetraquark operators, should be employed. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point, we investigated the importance of local tetraquark operators for the $T_{cc}$ spectrum by adding them to a large basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators. We performed this calculation using the distillation framework combined with a position-space sampling method that we recently developed. This method makes local tetraquark operators affordable in distillation. Upon including local tetraquark operators, we observe significant shifts in the estimates of several energy levels. Finally, we show the effect of these shifts on the $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts obtained from a single-channel $s$-wave Lüscher analysis."}

Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon."}

Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches."}

Geometry-only and geometry+morphology methods provide modest gains over the reconstruction baseline, and contrastive variants do not show stable improvement. Likelihood scoring on AE latents is consistently stronger: across three seeds, latent-only likelihood reaches ROC-AUC $0.8555\\pm 0.0181$ and PR-AUC $0.9219 \\pm 0.0118$, versus ROC-AUC $0.7663 \\pm 0.0450$ and PR-AUC $0.8667 \\pm 0.0255$ for AE+manifold.

The methodology divides phase space into seven physically motivated kinematic regions reflecting distinct production mechanisms from thermal freeze-out to perturbative QCD. Each region receives a quality score $Q_i \\in [10, 1000]$ via logarithmic transformation of local $χ^2_i/ν_i$ statistics, ranging from 10 (very poor agreement) to 1000 (perfect agreement). A composite rating $R$ aggregates weighted average, geometric mean, and minimum scores with dispersion penalty, preventing compensation of poor agreement in one region by artificial success elsewhere. Demonstrated on real ALICE and representative LHCb data for $K^0_S$ mesons and $Λ$ hyperons at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV in p-Pb collisions, the methodology reveals that no universal model exists: PYTHIA8 excels for mesons ($R=879$) via nuclear PDFs, while models with coalescence are potentially superior for baryons. The baryon anomaly peak serves as critical discriminator, with highest quality scores $Q_i \\sim 950\\text{--}1000$ in zones $3\\text{--}4$.

We then look at a wide class of examples, including the Schwarzschild BH and the Kerr BH in asymptotically flat spacetimes, the BTZ BH and the black brane in AdS spacetimes, as well as Lifshitz black holes and construct the explicit maps to the SC geometry to obtain results specific to each case. These results are reproduced by considering the probe particles and fields in the original BH background and taking the near-horizon limit of the solutions. Our encyclopedia of examples establishes the notion of SC geometries as near-horizon geometries of non-extremal black objects, paving the way for a detailed, intricate future analysis of the quantum aspects of this geometry."}

Prior work has advanced HOWFSC algorithms and profiled candidate implementations on radiation-hardened processors, highlighting a substantial gap between the computational demands of LUVOIR-scale HOWFSC and the capabilities of current onboard spacecraft hardware. In this paper, we argue that this gap can be closed by offloading the HOWFSC pipeline to a dedicated co-flying compute satellite at Sun-Earth L2. This approach enables the use of modern, radiation-tolerant high-performance processors without increasing risk to the primary observatory. We show that such an architecture can increase the end-to-end control cadence from the sub-hertz regime typical of radiation-hardened onboard processing or ground-in-the-loop operation to tens and even hundreds of hertz. We evaluate commercial hardware platforms in terms of performance and feasibility, and we propose custom architectures that enable higher control frequencies with significant power consumption reductions. Finally, we outline system-level considerations for co-flying compute, including reliability, satellite integration, and inter-satellite communication constraints."}

We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions. This allows us to determine the full particle spectrum and the total particle number in the strong-field and fully relativistic regime. Our analysis confirms the existence of particle creation in this setting and, crucially, reveals a distinct resonance structure in the spectrum."}

In this work, we examine the fine balance between using PDF sets with small uncertainties in the large-x region -- crucial for maximising BSM sensitivity -- and adopting conservative PDF fits that exclude high-energy data potentially contaminated by unaccounted NP contributions. We systematically assess a range of conservative PDF fitting strategies designed to mitigate such biases and provide a recommendation for the class of PDFs best suited for robust BSM searches. In addition, we investigate the alternative approach of performing simultaneous fits of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) Wilson coefficients and PDFs, thereby consistently accounting for their mutual correlations. Starting from a toy model to illustrate the underlying mechanisms, we then analyse two realistic NP scenarios: one modifying high-mass Drell-Yan production and another affecting the high-invariant-mass tail of top-quark pair production. Both cases are representative of measurements that will be probed with high precision during the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC."}

The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies.

Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical $4<z<6$ galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with \\texttt{Cloudy} modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced $F_{[\\rm CII]\\rm 158μm}/F_{\\rm Hα}$ ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing."}

ULPT reorganizes the standard Lagrangian approach by separating the Jacobian deviation, which generates the nonlinear source bispectrum, from the displacement-mapping effect that determines how long-wavelength bulk flows distort observed configurations. Within this structure, we derive general one-loop ULPT expressions for the bispectrum and analyze their infrared (IR) behavior, demonstrating exact, nonperturbative IR cancellation and the natural emergence of an IR-resummed description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping. In particular, ULPT enables a detailed and fully analytic treatment of the wiggle-wiggle contribution to the IR-resummed bispectrum, whose structure has remained comparatively unexplored in previous approaches. We further construct IR-resummed models for the cross bispectra of all pre- and post-reconstruction combinations. For configurations in which the displacement fields differ, ULPT captures not only the overall exponential damping but also the more intricate BAO-scale modulation characteristic of mixed pre/post bispectra. Our results clarify the physical origin of nonlinear BAO suppression and provide a compact theoretical framework in which the full ULPT bispectrum, once implemented numerically through displacement-mapping convolution integrals, will automatically encode all nonlinear BAO and IR effects. The framework developed here therefore offers a unified and IR-safe foundation for interpreting next-generation bispectrum measurements."}

We obtain a fully second order system of partial differential equation (PDE) that can be casted in a fully conservative way. We analyze the hyperbolicity of this model coupled to Einstein field equations using a newly developed technique that allows for hyperbolicity studies without explicit first order reduction. Furthermore, we identify a frame choice where our formulation is causal, stable and with positive entropy generation for a wide range of equations of state (EoS). Our analysis shows that the inclusion of an out-of-equilibrium correction to the charge current, plays an important role in guaranteeing the strong hyperbolicity and, therefore, the well-posedness of the system. If such correction is not applied, an extra frame restriction must be added to the present in the literature in order to obtain a strongly hyperbolic system."}

In this scenario, CP violation arises from complex Yukawa couplings, enabling the generation of asymmetries in both the Standard Model (SM) and DM sectors. We explore two regimes: (i) wash-in, where an initial dark asymmetry is transferred to SM leptons by $2 \\leftrightarrow 2$ scattering processes; and (ii) co-genesis, featuring a hierarchical coupling structure that allows enhanced CP violation while supporting a low-scale seesaw mechanism at order $\\mathcal{O}(2)$ TeV. This setup not only links light neutrino masses to the Majorana mass term but also suggests that lepton-number violation may occur at experimentally accessible energy scales. In the co-genesis scenario, we show spin-independent cross sections for DM heavier than 10 GeV that can be tested in current direct detection experiments and motivate the exploration of cross sections inside the neutrino fog for lighter DM masses, establishing asymmetric leptogenesis as a predictive benchmark framework for direct-detection experiments and identifying a new hierarchical-coupling regime enabling TeV-scale leptogenesis."}

Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $Ω_{\\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $σ_8=0.81\\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $Ω_{\\rm m}-σ_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model."}

Focusing on the perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational redshift, and gravitational light bending, we derive analytical expressions for orbital precession and demonstrate that, with suitable physically acceptable parameters, pseudo-Newtonian approaches can accurately reproduce the observed perihelion advance and gravitational redshift. However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity.

Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties.

Unlike standard mechanisms relying on classical dynamics or modified actions, this enhancement originates from the reduced density matrix of the observable sector after tracing over a hidden gravitational reservoir. This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive \"quantum birthmark\" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum. Furthermore, we forecast that this entanglement may manifest as a late-time stochastic noise enhancement in gravitational wave interferometers, offering a novel experimental window into the quantum nature of spacetime."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "An accurate model of the point spread function is required in order to estimate positions and brightnesses of stars in digitized images. The PSF of the Gaia space telescope is unusual due to the use of drift-scan mode and time-delayed integration, in which the satellite spins and precesses while images are captured. This induces several systematic and periodic distortions in the PSF that are unique to Gaia. These include systematic variations in the stellar image drift rate with respect to the charge transfer rate, and spatial variations in the CCD response that are, contrary to expectations, not marginalised by the use of TDI mode. These must be incorporated into the PSF model in order to reduce systematic errors in Gaia's data products.\n  We have developed a semi-analytic model of the PSF, in which the blurring effects of along- and across-scan stellar image motion are modelled analytically, and dependences of the PSF shape on source colour and position within the CCD are calibrated empirically. Constraints on the PSF origin are introduced in order to break a degeneracy with the geometric instrument calibration. Our new PSF model leads to significant improvements in the modelling of observations, particularly around the 11-13 magnitude range in G. This will contribute to reductions in the astrometric and photometric uncertainties in the derived data products. Our PSF model was deployed in the Gaia cyclic data processing systems and used in the production of the forthcoming Data Release 4. The linear part of Gaia's PSF is now well understood. Future development work will focus on the handling of several nonlinear effects that depend on the signal level, including charge transfer inefficiency and the brighter-fatter effect. This work will provide a useful reference for users of Gaia data and for other missions that use the same observing principles, such as the proposed GaiaNIR mission."}

The reliability of the PNP is tested by comparing key orbital properties -- marginally stable, marginally bound, photon orbits and energies at marginally stable orbit radii -- with exact MGR predictions. The PNP reproduces the marginally stable and photon orbits exactly, while marginally bound orbits and specific energies deviate by less than about 7-10%. The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition. The study demonstrates that the proposed PNP accurately captures essential spatial properties of MGR spacetime and provides an efficient, physically consistent tool for investigating accretion phenomena and strong-gravity astrophysics beyond general relativity."}

We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07."}

To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\\mathrm{S}^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ (\"slab\") topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters.

Here we investigate a novel quantum probe of strong-field gravity: the gravitomagnetic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for Cooper pairs propagating in Kerr spacetime. The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{tφ}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $Δθ= (4πm^* Ma/\\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter. Remarkably, the predicted phases reach $|Δθ| \\sim 10^{24}$ radians for Sgr~A* and $\\sim 10^{27}$ radians for M87*, reflecting the enormous gravitomagnetic flux near supermassive BHs. We analyze the dependence on interferometer geometry, demonstrate that tidal disruption of Cooper pairs is negligible at distances $r \\gtrsim 10\\,r_s$, and establish connections to the geometric Berry phase. Although direct experimental realization remains beyond current technology due to the vast distances involved, our framework provides quantitative predictions linking quantum coherence to spacetime curvature, complementing recent observations of gravitational AB phases in atom interferometry."}

Most notably, quantum tunneling is suppressed at special points in parameter space. In this paper we examine these deformed models in the case of double-well and cubic potentials, and we find that they have a rich phase structure. In what we call the strong coupling phase, the theory behaves like conventional quantum mechanics, instantons are real, and tunneling is not suppressed. In the weak coupling phase, the instantons responsible for tunneling become complex, and tunneling suppression takes place at the so-called Toda lattice points. At the critical point between the two phases, which corresponds to a monopole point in super Yang-Mills theory, the non-perturbative amplitudes display an anomalous scaling as a function of $\\hbar$. This phase structure reflects the physics of the underlying super Yang-Mills theory and can be regarded as a physical manifestation of wall-crossing behavior of the BPS spectrum, which we determine in our problem by using resurgent techniques."}

While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3\" or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations."}

Using new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, HST/ACS photometry, and orbital modeling, we re-examine the nature of W1. From our updated sample of 57 member stars, we find that past analyses included four binaries and seven non-members, identified here using Gaia proper motions and updated velocities. We continue to find a velocity dispersion consistent with previous analyses, measuring $σ_v = 4.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ from 49 stars out to $3~r_{\\rm half}$.

Our best-fit orbital model predicts that W1 is at apocenter, implying that W1 has been closer to the Milky Way in the recent past, reaching a pericentric distance $\\lesssim 25$ kpc from the Galactic center $\\sim0.3$ Gyr ago. Given its internal kinematics, metallicity spread, and lack of mass segregation, we conclude that W1 is a galaxy.

The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $α$-attractor $\\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $ζ$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $Δ\\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $Δ\\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range. Mapping the two-field dynamics to an effective single-field description in the Einstein frame, we obtain a spectral index $n_s\\simeq 0.968-0.971$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<10^{-3}$, fully consistent with Planck 2018 bounds.

We define the jet axes using the recoil-free winner-take-all (WTA) recombination scheme. For the azimuthal decorrelation $δφ$, this axis choice eliminates non-global logarithms (NGLs) entirely. For the transverse momentum imbalance $q_T$, NGLs emerge specifically in the small jet radius limit ($R \\ll 1$). In this regime, the WTA scheme simplifies the theoretical framework by restricting jet radius logarithms to the soft sector. We derive factorization formulae for both observables within soft-collinear effective theory. To address the small-$R$ NGLs in the $q_T$ distribution, we refactorize the soft function into global soft, collinear-soft, and ultra-collinear-soft modes. We perform the resummation of global large logarithms $\\ln(δφ)$ and $\\ln(q_T/Q)$ up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.

A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $ρ_{\\rm DE}+p_{\\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant."}

Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.\n  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = η(A/4G)^δ$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(χ) \\propto |χ|^{1-δ}$ where $χ$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-δ|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints."}

The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy."}

Starting from the separable Klein-Gordon equation for a massive neutral scalar field, we work in the low-frequency and slow-rotation regime and employ the analytical asymptotic matching (AAM) method to compute the reflection coefficient and the associated superradiant amplification factor. Since an exact global scattering solution is not available in this four-charge geometry, the AAM framework enables a controlled analytic treatment of the near-and far-region dynamics. We provide detailed and systematic derivations of the matching procedure leading to the closed-form amplification formula. The superradiant condition is obtained explicitly and we demonstrate that energy extraction occurs exclusively for co-rotating modes satisfying $Ω< m Ω_H$. We show that the presence of electric and magnetic charges suppresses the amplification relative to the Kerr limit, whereas lighter co-rotating scalar fields broaden the superradiant window and enhance the efficiency of rotational energy extraction."}

We propose that the complex scalar field, the so-called flavon, which breaks the Froggatt-Nielsen $U(1)$ symmetry and generates the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model, to also drive inflation, which we dub as Inflavon. After inflation ends, the decay of the inflavon reheats the Universe, establishing a novel link between early Universe cosmology and flavor physics. As concrete examples, we present realizations where the inflavon potential is described by an $α$-attractor potential. We then compute the resulting CMB observables, specifically the spectral index ($n_s$), the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), and the amplitude of scalar perturbations ($A_s$) as functions of the underlying Froggatt-Nielsen model parameters. We identify the parameter space in Froggatt-Nielsen models involving the scale of Flavor symmetry breaking $Λ_{\\rm FN}$ and FN charges which is ruled out by Planck and ACT data, as well as the region that could be probed by next-generation CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SO and LiteBIRD.

In particular, we demonstrate that the knowledge of the $w=-2$ metric functional and its behaviour under the near-horizon symmetry transformations allows us to derive the expressions and the properties of the remaining boost-weighted functionals via a recursive pattern. A similar recursive pattern also appears when evaluating the action of the near-horizon symmetry group on the evolution equations of these boost-weighted functionals. Again, the knowledge of the evolution equation of the boost $w=-2$ functional and its behaviour under symmetry transformations allows the remaining evolution equations to be determined using symmetry arguments. We also emphasize the role played by the duality symmetry in the characterization of the phase space of a null boundary and in the evaluation of the equation of motion. In conclusion, we derive the sub-leading Noether charges in the Einstein-Cartan-Holst formulation of gravity, showing that the imaginary part of the Weyl scalar $Ψ_2$ appears at the sub-leading order in the Holst charge."}

We carried out a comparison of redshifts from different sources and excluded some objects with redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra. We derive the reddening for them from the color excess with respect to dereddened counterparts with similar redshifts in the field. Comparisons of our reddenings with M31 reddening maps found no significant correlations. Most QSOs behind M31 show low reddening and do not probe high-extinctions underlining the need to identify fainter quasars behind nearby galaxies, especially behind higher extinction regions -- probably due to a bias towards following up brighter and less extinct candidates.

In this scenario, CP violation arises from complex Yukawa couplings, enabling the generation of asymmetries in both the Standard Model (SM) and DM sectors. We explore two regimes: (i) wash-in, where an initial dark asymmetry is transferred to SM leptons by $2 \\leftrightarrow 2$ scattering processes; and (ii) co-genesis, featuring a hierarchical coupling structure that allows enhanced CP violation while supporting a low-scale seesaw mechanism at order $\\mathcal{O}(2)$ TeV. This setup not only links light neutrino masses to the Majorana mass term but also suggests that lepton-number violation may occur at experimentally accessible energy scales. In the co-genesis scenario, we show spin-independent cross sections for DM heavier than 10 GeV that can be tested in current direct detection experiments and motivate the exploration of cross sections inside the neutrino fog for lighter DM masses, establishing asymmetric leptogenesis as a predictive benchmark framework for direct-detection experiments and identifying a new hierarchical-coupling regime enabling TeV-scale leptogenesis."}

Leveraging the extreme sensitivity of a K--Rb--$^{21}$Ne comagnetometer to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by axion DM, we analyzed our data in the context of the massively enhanced local gradient of axions due to interactions with matter, though no signal candidates were found. Consequently, we have set the most stringent limits on axion-neutron derivative interactions for masses $m_a \\in [0.041, ~28.9]~\\rm feV$, improving from previous experiments that ignore terrestrial matter effects by as much as three orders of magnitude for certain masses.

We present an overview of ACES, the 'Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CMZ Exploration Survey', a ~1.5\" angular resolution, 0.2-3 km/s spectral resolution ALMA Band 3 (85-102 GHz), survey of the 'Central Molecular Zone' (CMZ) -- the inner-100 pc of the Galaxy (l = 359.4 deg to 0.8 deg). ACES spectral setup is tuned to observe optimal tracers of the physical, chemical, and kinematic conditions in over 70 spectral features (e.g. HCO+, HNCO, SiO, H40alpha, complex molecules) of the gas in the CMZ, to derive the properties of all potentially star-forming Galactic Centre gas, from global scales (100 pc) to dense ~0.05 pc structures that are expected to host individual star-forming cores, down to sub-sonic (<0.4 km/s) velocity resolution. In this overview paper, we provide the scientific justification for the ACES survey, explain the choice of observational setup, and describe the data legacy products. Finally, we show some of the initial ACES data which highlight the power of ACES' combination of high angular resolution, unprecedented spatial dynamic range, sensitivity, spectral resolution and spectral bandwidth as an illustration of how ACES aims to understand how global processes set the location, intensity, and timescales for star formation and feedback in the CMZ."}

We then discuss how unitarity is restored through the resummation of the absorptive contributions to the incoming-state self-energy, generated by bound-state formation processes, taking into account their analytic structure in the complex momentum plane.

Traditional methods frequently necessitate extensive preprocessing, such as starlight subtraction and emission line deblending (e.g., Hα and [N II]), which can introduce substantial biases and uncertainties due to their model-dependent nature. In this work we developed an automated, diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between star-forming (SF), active galactic nuclei (AGN), low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), composite, and passive galaxies. We developed a diagnostic tool based on a support vector machine trained on data from optical emission-line ratios and color selection criteria. From literature studies and exploring combinations of discriminatory feature schemes, we found that the equivalent widths of Hβ, [O III]λ5007, and Hα+[N II]λ6548,84 as key diagnostic features. Additionally, galaxies classified as AGN can be distinguished into broad- and narrow-line AGN by measuring the full quarter at the half-maximum of Hα and [N II] complex. We have developed a diagnostic tool that encompasses all activities of galaxies while achieving high performance scores across all of them. Our diagnostic achieves overall accuracy of 83% and recall of 79% for SF, 94% for AGN, 85% for LINER, 77% for composite, and 96% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic tool significantly improves upon existing diagnostics as it eliminates the need for preprocessing (i.e., starlight subtraction or flux calibration) and spectral line fitting, includes all activity classes under one scheme, and distinguishes the two main AGN types. In addition, omitting starlight subtraction does not significantly reduce performance. Furthermore, Its narrow wavelength requirement enables use across a wide redshift range, making it ideal for high-z studies."}

Recently, Dragan and Ekert have significantly developed similar ideas even further, which lead to formulation of ``quantum principle of relativity'' that intimately links the two theories [2]. However, field theory descriptions of an on-shell tachyon, described by scalar field $φ$ with negative mass squared parameter, lead to violation of basic principles of relativity or quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate whether purely virtual tachyons can be consistent within the fakeon framework-the only known viable formulation of purely virtual particles. We identify two fatal obstructions. First, Lorentz boosts mix creation and annihilation operators, rendering the canonical commutation relations non-invariant despite formal invariance of the vacuum. Second, the real part of the tachyon Feynman propagator and Wheeler propagator have disjoint support, preventing application of both the fakeon prescription and Wheeler-Feynman absorber mechanism. Interactions with stable Standard Model fields further violate Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle, and we provide quantitative limit on coupling strength of such scenario. Our analysis excludes possibility of formulating covariant quantum field theory of interacting virtual tachyons."}

The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2$\\times$10$^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $μ$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary."}

We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07."}

The presented pipeline employs several state-of-the-art techniques by integrating them into a single, automated pipeline, enabling streamlined analysis of integral-field spectroscopy data, by allowing users to easily and directly extract valuable information on stellar populations, kinematics, dynamics, and gas properties. It automates multiple analysis techniques, including stellar population synthesis (Fado, Starlight, post-processing with RemoveYoung, kinematic extraction (pPXF, Bayes-LOSVD), and dynamical modelling (Dynamite).

Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances", "comment": "accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

The Standard Model (SM) is extended by a gauge-singlet Dirac sterile neutrino carrying a conserved dark charge, a real scalar mediator, and an auxiliary singlet fermion. DM is generated through the out-of-equilibrium decay of the mediator, which simultaneously produces a particle{antiparticle asymmetry in the sterile sector controlled by a CP-violating parameter. We show that the observed relic abundance can be naturally reproduced without thermal equilibration with the SM plasma. The resulting non-thermal momentum distribution is colder than a thermal Fermi{Dirac spectrum, ensuring consistency with structure formation constraints. Combining relic density, Lyman-α, Higgs invisible decay, and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bounds, we identify correlated and predictive regions of the parameter space characterized by non-trivial relations among the sterile neutrino mass and the decay parameters. This scenario provides a self-consistent realization of Dirac asymmetric sterile neutrino DM within an asymmetric freeze-in (AFI) framework, offering a constrained and testable alternative to conventional production mechanisms."}

MBB fits reveal beta variations from ~1.6-1.7 in diffuse regions to ~2.3-2.5 in dense star-forming areas, likely due to grain coagulation and changes in silicate-to-carbonaceous ratios. Dust masses from variable beta are up to ~4x higher than fixed-beta models, which systematically bias dust-to-stellar and dust-to-gas ratios. The small grain fraction rises from ~10% in the centre to ~15% in the diffuse disc, anti-correlated with the interstellar radiation field; gas-phase metallicity plays a minor role within 8 kpc.

Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics.

We measure sub-galactic star formation rates (SFR) by modeling spectrophotometric UV-IR data with flexible SFHs, and we produce point-source-subtracted maps of the diffuse X-ray emission using Chandra data. We extract and fit the spectra of 5 regions selected by their SFR density $Σ_{\\rm SFR}$, deriving hot gas luminosities and plasma temperatures. We examine the sub-galactic $kT-Σ_{\\rm SFR}$ and $L^{\\rm gas}_X-Σ_{\\rm SFR}$ scaling relations in NGC 4254, and compare to predictions from simple models of the feedback into the ISM from core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The hot gas emission from NGC 4254 is consistent with thermalization of $\\approx 40-50\\%$ of the energy from CCSNe in the ISM, and mass-loading of the CCSNe ejecta which decreases as $Σ_{\\rm SFR}^{-1/3}$. Our optimized model implies a temperature and X-ray production efficiency that scale as $kT = (0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.18}~{\\rm keV}) Σ_{\\rm SFR}^{0.34\\pm0.10}$ and $η= (0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}) Σ_{\\rm SFR}^{0.34\\pm0.18}$, respectively, for $Σ_{\\rm SFR} = 0.01-0.13~{\\rm M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. We also compare the properties of the hot ISM to other ISM phases using data from the PHANGS program. The diffuse X-ray emission of a given region is on average 200 times fainter than the H$α$ emission, and we see evidence that the hot ISM is over-pressurized compared to the large-scale dynamical equilibrium pressure of the galaxy, consistent with expansion of the hot ISM into the ambient medium."}

Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.\n  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = η(A/4G)^δ$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(χ) \\propto |χ|^{1-δ}$ where $χ$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-δ|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints."}

Building on this, we explicitly show that special cases of this null fluid/gravity correspondence can be obtained as an ultra-relativistic limit of the usual fluid/gravity correspondence in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow approaches the speed of light.

Working within a minimal Higgs-portal extension, we allow the dark sector to possess a higher temperature at the electroweak epoch while remaining consistent with cosmological bounds on additional relativistic degrees of freedom. The temperature hierarchy modifies the thermal structure of the effective potential and alters nucleation dynamics without requiring large portal couplings or extreme supercooling. Within the cosmologically allowed window, we find a monotonic enhancement of the gravitational wave amplitude by more than an order of magnitude compared to the standard thermal case, accompanied by a shift of the peak frequency within the millihertz regime. The resulting stochastic background moves substantially closer to the projected sensitivity of future space-based interferometers. Our results demonstrate that hidden-sector temperature hierarchies can leave observable imprints on electroweak-scale phase transitions even in minimal and perturbative frameworks."}

We analyze the hyperbolicity of this model coupled to Einstein field equations using a newly developed technique that allows for hyperbolicity studies without explicit first order reduction. Furthermore, we identify a frame choice where our formulation is causal, stable and with positive entropy generation for a wide range of equations of state (EoS). Our analysis shows that the inclusion of an out-of-equilibrium correction to the charge current, plays an important role in guaranteeing the strong hyperbolicity and, therefore, the well-posedness of the system.

In the event that at least one of these SMBHs is actively accreting, the system can appear phenomenologically as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a broad line region (BLR) kinematically offset from the host galaxy rest frame. Such velocity offsets have been interpreted as signatures of binary SMBHs, recoiling SMBHs, or BLR gas dynamics within a single-SMBH system. We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of five nearby (0.1 < z < 0.2) Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars whose broad emission lines are Doppler-shifted relative to their host galaxies' systemic velocities, along with archival Chandra observations of 11 additional sources from the same sample. Using our Chandra data, we constrain SMBH masses with multiple independent techniques. We find systematic, method-dependent differences among black hole mass estimates, with masses inferred from the fundamental plane of black hole activity generally lower and single-epoch virial masses typically higher than those obtained using other methods. We also compare the X-ray photon indices and optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of our quasars to the broader quasar population. While we find no strong differences in optical-to-X-ray spectral indices, we do find systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typically observed in comparable quasars. These results constrain competing physical models but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against a binary SMBH origin of the velocity-offset BLRs."}

Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we investigate how distances to filament spines and cluster-scale nodes jointly and independently influence galaxy evolution. Galaxies are classified into red, green, and blue populations through a fully data-driven entropic thresholding technique, and the nodes and filaments are identified using DisPerSE. We find that red galaxies preferentially reside near filament cores and nodes, whereas blue galaxies dominate the outskirts. This spatial segregation reveals two characteristic transition scales: a node-related crossover at $\\sim 2.5~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and a filament-related crossover at $\\sim 0.75~\\mathrm{Mpc}$. To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments."}

Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches."}

Requiring invariance of the kinetic terms under such transformations specifies the form of (Φ\\dagger)^\\prime. An analogous strategy is also adopted for fermionic fields. This offers a systematic way to construct new GOOFy-invariant field-theoretical models. It turns out that theories which are invariant with respect these GOOFy transformations satisfy relations among parameters that are found to be RGE-stable up to two and three loop orders, thus constituting fixed-points under running of the RGE. This has been verified for various theories containing different numbers of bosonic and fermionic fields. In particular it has been shown that the Standard Model (SM) can not be a viable electroweak theory if demanding invariance under GOOFy transformations. However, the two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) may be invariant under GOOFy transformations (Yukawa couplings included), providing an interesting phenomenological example of physics beyond the SM. The most striking aspect of this study is the RGE stability of new relations between model parameters in a wide class of field theories. We also present a set of new relations between 2HDM potential parameters that constitute a fixed point under the running of the RGE up to at least three loop order."}

The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{tφ}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $Δθ= (4πm^* Ma/\\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter.

Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.\n  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = η(A/4G)^δ$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(χ) \\propto |χ|^{1-δ}$ where $χ$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-δ|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology.

Despite numerous observational efforts over the past decade, a statistically robust sample of \"satellite planes\" across the diversity of host galaxy environments is lacking. To guide future observing strategies, we construct a controlled suite of mock observations of on-sky positions and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of isolated L* host galaxies and their satellite systems, based on samples drawn from the Illustris TNG100-1 cosmological simulation to build a statistical sample. In these mock systems, satellite planes are defined by three key parameters: the number of satellites ($N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$), the fraction residing in a thin co-rotating plane ($f_{p}$), and the orientation angle relative to the observer ($θ_{\\mathrm{rot}}$). We evaluate the sensitivity of three observational metrics, $N_{\\mathrm{cor}}$ (number of co-rotating satellites), $b/a$ (projected flattening of the satellite distribution), and $v_\\mathrm{los}$ (mean absolute LOS velocity), to the presence of such planes. Our results show that detection rates are strongly dependent on $θ_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Satellite planes that are viewed nearly edge-on or face-on, are the most readily detected. In contrast, intermediate orientations and systems with fewer satellites yield low detection success rates. Generally, only satellite planes with $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}>20$ have high chances of being detected. These findings provide a practical framework for prioritising observational targets and designing future surveys aimed at detecting and characterising satellite planes."}

Here we put forward a new physical model to explain how a large number of small dusty gas clumps form and they collectively appear as a geometrically thick dynamic dusty torus. The circumnuclear hot gas flows towards the central black hole (BH) and forms a rotating disk on sub-pc scales. A fraction of inflowing hot gas condenses to form small cold clumps due to thermal instabilities, when the accretion rate is sufficiently high. These cold dusty gas clumps are irradiated by the central accretion disk and re-radiate as dust emission mostly in the infrared. We propose that the dusty torus in AGN consists of such cold clumps vertically supported by the radiation force against gravity. For clumps with suitable column density, the vertical component of the BH gravity is in quasi-static equilibrium with the infrared radiation force together with the vertical component of the disk radiation force. Our model is robust in the sense that for any reasonable range of parameters concerning clump vertical dynamical equilibrium a torus exists. We further show that the hot gas in the rotating flow condenses to cold clumps only if its accretion rate is higher than about one percent of the Eddington rate. The radiation force is unable to lift the cold gas clumps up away from the mid-plane when the luminosity of the disk surrounding the BH is lower than 0.1 percent of the Eddington luminosity. These two features of our model may provide a physical explanation for the lack of evidence of dusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs."}

The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive \"quantum birthmark\" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum.

At the same time, the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) for inclusive semileptonic decays is known up to and including terms of order $1/m_Q^5$. Therefore, it is desirable to extend the definition of the kinetic mass to higher orders in $1/m_Q$. The original kinetic mass is based on the hadron-mass formula in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). However, the HQE is formulated in terms of matrix elements defined in full QCD to avoid the appearance of non-local matrix elements. To avoid this, we develop a definition of the kinetic mass rooted in full QCD. Starting from the hadron-mass formula derived from the energy-momentum tensor of full QCD, we define a relation between a general mass and the pole mass. Using a simple cut-off scheme, we compute a generalized kinetic mass at one loop to all powers of $1/m_Q$, which reproduces the well-known results for the kinetic mass up to $1/m_Q^2$. Our approach opens the road to a consistent use of the kinetic mass at higher-orders in the heavy quark expansion."}

Since an exact global scattering solution is not available in this four-charge geometry, the AAM framework enables a controlled analytic treatment of the near-and far-region dynamics. We provide detailed and systematic derivations of the matching procedure leading to the closed-form amplification formula. The superradiant condition is obtained explicitly and we demonstrate that energy extraction occurs exclusively for co-rotating modes satisfying $Ω< m Ω_H$.

Models often assume that Pop III stellar masses in different minihaloes are stochastic realisations of a single universal initial mass function (IMF). We use 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to test this assumption and to map the first-star IMF across redshift, halo mass, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocity (SV). We construct a dense-cloud merger tree and assign first-star masses by mapping the radial gas accretion-rate profile to stellar mass, yielding per-halo stellar mass functions without imposing any a priori IMF. The high-mass tail and multiplicity increase systematically with redshift, halo mass, and SV. Low-mass, low-SV haloes form only one or a few first stars, whereas massive, high-SV haloes host rich first star clusters and commonly produce very massive ($\\gtrsim10^3$-$10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) first stars. Even in a fixed environment, halo-to-halo scatter remains substantial. Nevertheless, group-averaged IMFs converge to well-defined forms, ruling out a single universal IMF at the halo level across the range of environments probed here. Mapping our seeds onto the redshift-mass plane, we show that high-SV and massive haloes preferentially populate the heavy-seed regime relevant to luminous high-redshift sources. At the same time, low-SV environments are consistent with single/few-event enrichment signatures in metal-poor stars.

In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics.

In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time.

A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $ρ_{\\rm DE}+p_{\\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant."}

While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density.Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \\propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $> 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs."}

At the same time, the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) for inclusive semileptonic decays is known up to and including terms of order $1/m_Q^5$. Therefore, it is desirable to extend the definition of the kinetic mass to higher orders in $1/m_Q$. The original kinetic mass is based on the hadron-mass formula in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). However, the HQE is formulated in terms of matrix elements defined in full QCD to avoid the appearance of non-local matrix elements. To avoid this, we develop a definition of the kinetic mass rooted in full QCD. Starting from the hadron-mass formula derived from the energy-momentum tensor of full QCD, we define a relation between a general mass and the pole mass. Using a simple cut-off scheme, we compute a generalized kinetic mass at one loop to all powers of $1/m_Q$, which reproduces the well-known results for the kinetic mass up to $1/m_Q^2$. Our approach opens the road to a consistent use of the kinetic mass at higher-orders in the heavy quark expansion."}

In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture."}

Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces.

Here we show that such scattering reaches a steady-state distribution function of stellar eccentricity, after which eccentricity increases and decreases occur at equal rates. The implication is that clump/cloud scattering recircularizes eccentric stellar orbits, keeping the stellar velocity dispersion in a limited range. This re-circularization regulates disk heating and maintains kinematic coherence, contributing to the longevity of disk structures. The eccentricity distribution function and the presence of recircularizing cloud-star interactions are independent of cloud mass but the timescale to reach equilibrium decreases with increasing mass. The calculations are made in the simplest possible disk system to highlight the effects of scattering without contamination from spiral waves, star formation, and other processes. The calculations also reveal a bifurcation in the disk evolutions whereby in a minority of cases temporary asymmetries in the clump spatial distribution drive the disks to an end state of increased velocity dispersion and orbital eccentricity corresponding to early type disks. Overall the models emphasize an important physical process that can make and maintain an exponential stellar disk in all galaxies with a cloudy interstellar medium."}

The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $μ= 24.85\\pm0.05$ ($0.93\\pm0.02$ Mpc).

Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $Ω_{\\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $σ_8=0.81\\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $Ω_{\\rm m}-σ_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences.

In this work, we present a framework to simulate the neutral hydrogen 21cm emission line in such large-scale HI galaxy surveys. This framework is developed as a modular layer that builds on semi-analytical models. In particular we use as bases the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models, coupled to merger trees from the Millennium Simulation suite. We validate our framework against local Universe observations, demonstrating consistency with velocity functions, and generalised Tully-Fisher relations. Predictions based on GAEA and L-Galaxies exhibit mutual consistency despite the distinct underlying physical prescriptions. We construct mock galaxy catalogues that incorporate forward-modelled selection functions, inclination effects, and redshift broadening, reproducing the statistical distributions of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey. Finally, we present redshift distribution forecasts for future SKA Observatory HI galaxy surveys. This framework offers a flexible tool for interpreting upcoming large-scale radio surveys and studying HI line observables as cosmological probes."}
