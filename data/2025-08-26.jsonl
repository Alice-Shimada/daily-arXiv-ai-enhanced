Our analysis reveals\nthat a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early\nDark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble\nfriction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological\nconstant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and\neventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark\nenergy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on\nfinely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a\nconsequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter,\noffering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions.\nThis framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature\nspectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for\nthe observed low-$\\ell$ anomaly.

By examining the physics content of\nMCDs in various classical and quantum systems, we find that momentum current\nflow originates from both kinetic motion of particles and forces between them,\nand furthermore, the forces alone cannot determine the interaction MCDs\nunambiguously, same as the interaction energy potentials and consistent with\nNoether's theorem. Only in special cases where there are short-range forces\nbetween different elements of a system, or short-range interactions with\nexternal boundaries that result in discontinuities of MCDs, can the relevant\ncomponents be interpreted as surface forces, i.e., mechanical pressures and\nshear forces. For the nucleon in QCD, the range of quark and gluon interactions\nis comparable to its size and far from short, and we fail to identify any\ninteraction component of the MCD as pressure/shear forces between different\nparts of the nucleon, nor the total through the form factor $C/D$ which merely\ndepicts the total momentum flux seen through gravity. Following our previous\nstudy of the forces through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the\ngluon scalar field in the QCD trace anomaly provides a confining force\npotential on the quarks, with a strength consistent with that between heavy\nquarks."}

We present a subgrid model for\nsimulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively\nlow-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological\nsimulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its\ninteraction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing\ndrag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms\nfor single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent\nwith high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst\ngalaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates\nof high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold\noutflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold\ninterstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the\nacceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties:\nstronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot\nphase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the\norigin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas\nmostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to\nsubstantial cold gas formation from the hot phase.

In isolated systems, the intrinsic\ntiming of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary.\nThe presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst\ntiming. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel\napproach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing\nmodels account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction\neffects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the\ninner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that\nincorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the\nbinary's pericenter.

Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\\sim\n\\lambda \\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16\\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer\nbe that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\\frac{G}{\\lambda}$ and hence gravity\ncan be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having\nstronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects\na stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is\nnot prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is\nthat it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary\ngravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of\nthe quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials,\nsuch as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation."}

Two themes\nare examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary\ncorrelators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming\ncontributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover\nbranch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics\nthat cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the\nboundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring\nanalyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics\nand OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal\nstress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic\ncalculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust\nuniversal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three\nuniversal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these\nfunctions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the\nthermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality\nconstraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that\nANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our\nresults demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor\nsector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and\nuniversality in holographic CFTs."}

In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR)\nluminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar\nmedium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR\nluminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first\nseveral thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value.\nAfterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas\nand their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show\nhow the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of\nthe gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the\nsignificant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity\npeaks at the range centered at 70$\\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered\nas the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that\nduring evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only\nslightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase,\nthe strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their\nluminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\\sim\n10-10^3$ times.

To address these issues, we propose a general\ndisformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a\nfield-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions\nincluding conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals\nthat a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early\nDark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble\nfriction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological\nconstant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and\neventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark\nenergy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on\nfinely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a\nconsequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter,\noffering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions.\nThis framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature\nspectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for\nthe observed low-$\\ell$ anomaly.

Initially, using the cut-and-paste technique, we perform a\nlinearized stability analysis in the presence of a general cosmological\nconstant. Our results show that for sufficiently large positive values of the\ncosmological constant, corresponding to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry,\nthe stability regions of the wormhole solutions are significantly enhanced\ncompared to the Schwarzschild case. Subsequently, we construct static\nthin-shell solutions by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior\nvacuum spacetime across a junction surface. In the spirit of minimizing the\npresence of exotic matter, we identify parameter domains in which the null and\nweak energy conditions are satisfied at the shell. We examine the surface\nstress-energy components in detail, determining regions where the tangential\nsurface pressure is either positive or negative, interpreted, respectively, as\nthe pressure or surface tension. Additionally, an expression describing the\nbehavior of the radial pressure across the junction is derived. Finally, we\ndetermine key geometrical characteristics of the wormhole, including the throat\nradius and the junction interface radius, by imposing traversability\nconditions. Estimates for the traversal time and required velocity are also\nprovided, further elucidating the physical viability of these configurations."}

The catalog provides information about the identified\ncandidates, such as the arrival time and amplitude of the signal and properties\nof the signal's source as inferred from the observational data. GWTC is the\ndata release of this dataset and version 4.0 extends the catalog to include\nobservations made during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nobserving run up until 2024 January 31. This paper marks an introduction to a\ncollection of articles related to this version of the catalog, GWTC-4.0. The\ncollection of articles accompanying the catalog provides documentation of the\nmethods used to analyze the data, summaries of the catalog of events,\nobservational measurements drawn from the population, and detailed discussions\nof selected candidates"}

This is an open\narea of research still a century after the initial development of formal\nquantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the\ndescription of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be\nhighlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively\naddresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime\nbackgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this\nreview article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum\nfeatures of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black\nholes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of\nthe role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also\nshows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics."}

Producing the contents of the GWTC from\ndetector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to\nmodel the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of\nthe data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of\neach transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary\ncoalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these\ndifferent analyses.

In this method, the Fourier transform is\nimplemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum\nfluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons\ncan be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined\nto a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past\nhorizon and their absorption at the future horizon.

Our analysis reveals\nthat a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early\nDark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble\nfriction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological\nconstant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and\neventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark\nenergy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on\nfinely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a\nconsequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter,\noffering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions.\nThis framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature\nspectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for\nthe observed low-$\\ell$ anomaly.

Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature\nperturbation spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo\nsimulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially\nin multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from\nthe initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\\delta N$\nfrom the paths, and then estimate $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$. However, this method\ninvolves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch\npaths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of\ninterest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a\nnew Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing\ntwo novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple\nestimator of a key statistic $\\langle \\delta\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbf{X}}^2\\rangle$,\nthe variance of $\\delta \\mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to\navoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a\nparametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just\nan estimate of $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an\napproximating function of $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of\ninterest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation\nmodels, which show the usefulness of our method."}

By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen\nsolution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like\naxisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and\nthe influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically\ninvestigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo\nradius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the\nnull geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the\npresence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion,\nand significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow.\nFurthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations,\nwe compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the\nfrequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the\nhalo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter\nenvironment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and\ngravitational wave observations."}

Then we further apply the background subtraction method to\ncalculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy induced by the higher\nderivative terms up to the quadratic of Riemann tensor for the 5-dimensional\nKerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result\nobtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn\nsubstantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method."}
