We prove that given a reference solution of Einstein gravity in the first-order formulation, a second off-shell configuration uplifts to a unique complex structure deformation in six dimensions. If the configuration satisfies Einstein's equations, the complex structure deformation is integrable, i.e. a solution of Kodaira-Spencer gravity.

The cubic sector can be written in terms of $Z_3$--symmetric trilinear Hirota operators, revealing a hidden integrable structure. For $δ=2$, using the explicit Tomimatsu--Sato polynomials, we verify that this trilinear sector coincides with a Yu--Toda--Sasa--Fukuyama (YTSF) equation-type kernel.

Accepted for publication in JATIS", "summary": "Observations in the near-infrared using large ground-based telescopes are adversely impacted by bright atmospheric emission lines, particularly the OH Meinel bands. These lines can saturate a moderate-resolution spectrograph on the order of minutes, resulting in information loss at the wavelengths of the lines. OH lines also vary on similar timescales, requiring frequent sky exposures to be able to subtract the sky spectrum from that of the target. In this paper we present a new method, which we call bright region reset (BRR), to prevent the saturation of these lines in near-infrared spectra while simultaneously improving information about their variability. This is accomplished by periodically resetting pixels that contain bright lines on a detector capable of sub-window readout while the rest of the detector continues integrating. This method is demonstrated on the McKellar Spectrograph in the 1.2 m telescope at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, Canada. Using a Teledyne H2RG detector, we reset the emission lines produced by an arc lamp while still recording their flux. We show no degradation in the resulting spectrum compared to a conventional observing mode. Unlike other OH line mitigation strategies, the BRR method not only avoids loss of information at wavelengths containing the lines, but also provides higher-cadence information on sky line variability, making it a promising technique for implementation at observatories. We advocate demonstrating this method on sky at existing 8--10 m class facilities with near-infrared spectrographs equipped with HxRG detectors in order to test its feasibility for use in sky subtraction schemes for premier modern spectrographs, including the upcoming generation of instruments for the Extremely Large Telescopes."}

However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time."}

Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M_{\\rm BH}\\simeq 10^{6-7}~M_\\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 5000~{\\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising."}

Our motivation is that those hypothesized remnants of inhomogeneous energetic fluctuations in the early universe, though too small for direct detection, are thought to have a mass range similar to that of planets. Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs. In particular we focus on the objects Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f, Gliese 686 b, HR 5183 b, HD 20794 e, and Wolf 1061 d, each of which has been found using the radial velocity method but never imaged (either directly or through transit). We also examine the microlensing events MOA 2009-BLG-387L and OGLE-2016-BLG-1540, which offer promise as candidate PBHs. We present these as a representative, but not exclusive list, of potential PBH contenders.

Comments Welcome!

In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge."}

Our approach exploits the predicted spin features of each formation channel, and adopts parameterized models of the predicted correlations between the spin magnitudes (and orientations) and mass, inspired by first principles. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence. Finally, the mass-spin correlation predicted by the primordial scenario gives a poor fit to the data, and this scenario can only account for a subset of the observed events."}

Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds.

We decompose the observed motions into internal components, generated by mass fluctuations within 200Mpc/h, and external ones arising from structures beyond this volume. A weighted average technique is developed to test the model's self consistency while minimizing the impact of non Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.9 pm 0.1 km/s/ Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources.

Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6<z<7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($β$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158μm}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar.

In doing so we review standard models of MQM and their relation to string theory, D-brane physics, and emergent non-commutative geometries. We overview, in generality, definitions of subsystems and entanglement entropies in theories with gauge redundancy and discuss the additional structure required for definining subsystems in MQMs possessing a $U(N)$ gauge redundancy. In connecting these subsystems to non-commutative geometry, we review several works on `target space entanglement,' and entanglement in non-commutative field theories, highlighting the conditions in which target space entanglement entropy displays an `area law' at large $N$. We summarize several example calculations of entanglement entropy in non-commutative geometries and MQMs. We review recent work in connecting the area law entanglement of MQM to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, highlighting the conditions in which $U(N)$ invariance implies a minimal area formula for the entanglement entropy at large $N$. Finally, we make comments on open questions and research directions."}

Our simulations of the associated Schrödinger-Poisson system for non-relativistic and spherically symmetric clouds reveal that a scalar cloud may (partially) survive as a self-gravitating boson star if the black hole evaporates adiabatically until its mass becomes less than one half of the cloud's mass. This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles."}

This process produces a time delay and an extended gamma-ray halo around the source, which are looked for. We propose a new signature of electromagnetic echoes: the asymmetry of the gamma-ray distribution around blazars. As a measure of asymmetry, we use the offset of the gamma-ray distribution to the location of the blazar. This offset is due to the tilt of the jet of the blazar relative to the line of sight. Using a subsample of the 10 brightest BL Lacs, we exclude the range of extragalactic magnetic fields from $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-14}$ G, assuming that these objects have maintained a constant average luminosity over hundreds of thousands of years."}

Many satellite galaxies preserve substantial gas reservoirs, yet show signs of outer gas stripping, reminiscent of jellyfish galaxies in clusters. In contrast, low-mass satellites ($<10^8 \\, M_{\\odot}$) are largely gas-deficient, and some of them undergo gas removal within their host group by external pressure triggered by either galaxy interactions or ram pressure exerted by the hot intragroup medium. Complete gas removal in these satellite galaxies occurs when the external hydrodynamic pressure exceeds the gravitational restoring force, typically due to stochastic events such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or nearby galactic outflows. The emergence of a characteristic stellar mass of $10^8 \\, M_{\\odot}$ which determines the efficiency of gas removal in groups, likely reflects the differing scaling relations of external pressure with halo mass and gravitational restoring force with stellar mass. While tidal interactions can be a significant cause of gas loss in satellite galaxies, those severe enough to affect the gas content in the central regions typically lead to the complete disruption of the galaxy. Consequently, gas loss driven by tidal interactions may be underestimated in the studies focusing solely on surviving galaxies. Group environments, where environmental effects are weaker and satellite galaxies tend to have lower restoring forces due to their low masses, exhibit complex manifestations of gas loss that are not seen in more massive environments such as clusters."}

Tests of King non-linearity (NL) along isotope chains have been proposed as a tool to search for fifth-force mediators. At the same time, these tests can potentially teach us about the structure of heavy nuclei at unprecedented precision, where King NL has already been observed in several systems. A robust interpretation of the existing data, however, is hampered by incomplete control over the Standard Model (SM) contributions. We develop a systematic effective field theory framework, matching the SM onto scalar non-relativistic QED in the infinite nuclear mass limit and then onto quantum-mechanical potentials. This approach organizes all nuclear effects into a small set of Wilson coefficients and cleanly separates short- and long-distance physics. We show that the commonly used treatment of the $\\langle r^2\\rangle^2$ term needs to be reconsidered, as it arises only at second-order in perturbation theory, and we derive the long-range $1/r^4$ potential from nuclear polarizability. Applying the framework to hydrogen-like systems, we provide a transparent classification of SM sources of King NL relevant for current and future isotope-shift experiments. The formalism can be applied to learn about the shape of the heavy scalar nuclei at a higher level of precision and detail than what was previously attainable."}

We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \\emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state.

Why the universe has such these values is one of the deepest questions in science. Here we propose that these constants arise from quantum mechanics itself. By enlarging the configuration space of quantum cosmology, we treat the constants of nature as part of the wavefunction of the universe. The universal wavefunction contains support for many possible sets of constants, and early-universe processes cause these possibilities to decohere into distinct classical universes. Our universe is one such branch, compatible with complexity and life. We defined the Grand Hilbert Space as the direct sum of U-sectors, each representing a distinct set of physical laws. We derived the Meta-Wheeler--DeWitt equation, which governs the dynamics of the theory parameters. We showed that in the Planck era, the kinetic terms for these parameters are active, creating a state of primordial coherence where the laws of physics effectively fluctuate. This formalism offers a quantitative tool for high-energy physics. We proposed that the total integrated amplitude over theory space serves as a Bayesian evidence metric, allowing for the statistical comparison of rival microscopic theories based on their fertility in generating habitable sectors. Finally, this work makes a specific, falsifiable prediction: there will never be a successful, purely mathematical derivation of the Standard Model parameters."}

Consisting of 153 autonomous radio-detector stations spread over $17$\\,km$^2$, it detects radio waves in the frequency range of $30$ to $80$\\,MHz. Accurate characterization of the detector response is crucial for proper interpretation of the collected data. Previously, this was achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and simulations and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this paper, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average frequency spectra recorded by the stations with predictions from seven different models of the full radio sky, accounting for the system response, which includes the antenna, filters, and amplifiers. The analysis of the calibration constants over a period of seven years shows no relevant and no significant ageing effect in the AERA antennas. This result confirms the long-term stability of the detector stations and demonstrates the possibility for a radio detector to effectively monitor ageing effects of other detectors operating over extended periods."}

Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from $\\sim$2:1 to $\\gtrsim$10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias. We obtain $M_{200c} = 15.11^{+2.48}_{-2.10} \\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$ for the main cluster and $1.49^{+0.32}_{-0.25} \\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$ for the subcluster, yielding a mass ratio of $10.14^{+3.22}_{-2.47}$, definitively classifying the Bullet Cluster as a minor merger.

We investigate how this behaviour is modified in the presence of a neutral pseudoscalar that couples to gluons and top quarks, using an effective description that consistently incorporates perturbative Standard Model and new physics contributions, their interference and non-perturbative threshold effects. We show that the combined effect of those ingredients markedly shapes the viable region of the pseudoscalar parameter space, particularly for narrow resonances with masses close to twice the top mass. While Standard Model threshold effects could explain a sizeable part of the measured enhancements, the current data remain compatible with additional contributions from pseudoscalar interactions."}

We address this question in a single, connected spacetime where quantum field theory is coupled to classical general relativity, and where black holes, traversable wormholes, and time-symmetric or retrocausal formulations of quantum mechanics might naively appear to open channels for entropy export or cancellation. After distinguishing fine-grained, coarse-grained, and generalized gravitational entropy, and formulating a cosmological coarse-grained entropy, we treat black hole evaporation, wormholes constrained by quantum energy inequalities, and two-time boundary-value frameworks (including absorber-type and two-state-vector formalisms) within a common information-theoretic language. We then introduce a \"Global Entropy Transport\" (GET) framework and derive a sectoral inequality that bounds the net decrease of matter-plus-radiation entropy in terms of changes in horizon area and correlation (mutual-information) terms, assuming the generalized second law and modern focusing and energy conditions. Within this framework, black holes, wormholes, and retrocausal protocols can at most redistribute entropy among matter, radiation, and gravitational sectors and reshape the local pattern of entropy production. They do not, under current semiclassical, holographic, and statistical-mechanical constraints, permit a genuine reversal of the universal thermodynamic arrow in a single connected universe."}

Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \\pm 0.06$, $\\log(M_\\ast/M_{\\odot}) = 9.14 \\pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper.

Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $< 0.2\\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution."}

For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\\infty,1]\\cup[25,\\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{(-\\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{(-\\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant."}

We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field."}

The key science topics for the next decades require both approaches and both are developing rapidly towards major performance advances and full sky coverage. I will briefly outline the status and roles of the projects CTAO and SWGO which will dominate the next decade. Beyond these projects are several developments which might boost performance at both ends of the ground-based gamma-ray energy range, including the plenoscope approach at low energies and diverse approaches to ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy; from lake-based instruments to arrays of very small Cherenkov telescopes.

We carefully match mock and data properties and we mimic measurements of distance indicators and peculiar velocities, which follow the same statistical properties as real data. Mock samples of type-Ia supernovae also complement the other two distance indicators. Our 675 available mock realizations were used consistently by our three different methodologies described in our companion papers that measure the growth rate of structure $fσ_8$ with DESI PV DR1.

While the latest TDCOSMO results relied mainly on quadruply lensed quasars, doubly lensed systems are far more common and offer precise time delays, potentially enlarging the usable sample by a factor of five and enabling percent-level constraints on H_0. We present the first TDCOSMO analysis of a doubly imaged source, HE1104-1805, including the measurement of the four necessary ingredients. First, by combining 17 years of data from the SMARTS, Euler and WFI telescopes, we measure a time delay of 176.3\\pm 10.8 days. Second, using MUSE data, we extract stellar velocity dispersion measurements in three radial bins with up to 5% precision. Third, employing F160W HST imaging for lens modelling and marginalising over various modelling choices, we measure the Fermat potential difference between the images. Fourth, using wide-field imaging, we measure the convergence added by objects not included in the lens modelling. Hence, we measure the time delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the deflector, favouring a power-law mass model over a baryonic and dark matter composite model. The measurement was performed blindly and yielded H_0 = 64.2^{+5.8}_{-5.0} x $λ_{int} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, where λ_{int} is the internal mass sheet degeneracy parameter. This is in agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 milestone and its precision for λ_{int}=1 is comparable to that obtained with the best-observed quadruply lensed quasars (4-6%). This work is a stepping stone towards a precise measurement of H_0 using a large sample of doubly lensed quasars, supplementing the current sample. The next TDCOSMO milestone paper will include this system in its hierarchical analysis, constraining λ_{int} and H_0 jointly with multiple lenses."}

Due to the Majorana nature of RHNs, the final state can be the same-sign dilepton plus jets leading to 2 units of LNV. As a simple but plausible scenario, we investigate such a signal in models with a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry which naturally introduces three RHNs for gauge anomaly cancellation, and is spontaneously broken down by a vacuum expectation value of an isospin singlet scalar field ($φ$). In this scenario, $h$ and the Z boson can decay into a pair of RHNs via the $h$-$φ$ mixing and the $Z$-$Z'$ mixing with $Z'$ being a new massive gauge boson, respectively. Estimating the LNV signal and corresponding backgrounds for the $\\ell^{\\pm} \\ell^{\\pm} 4j$ final states, we find bounds on the $h$-$φ$ mixing and the $Z$-$Z^\\prime$ mixing as a function of a mass of RHNs at Higgs factories, e.g., at High-Luminosity LHC with $\\sqrt{s}=$ 14 TeV, future $e^-e^+$ colliders at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 250 GeV, muon colliders at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 125 GeV as well as at Z factories, e.g., CEPC and FCC-ee at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 91.2 GeV.

The source shows the characteristic \"V-shaped\" SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, $μ\\sim11$ for image S1 and $μ\\sim7$ for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of $\\sim 20$ pc (red) and $\\sim60$ pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+H$β$), which reaches scales of order $\\sim$1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass ($\\log M_\\star/M_\\odot>10$) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components.

As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite."}

Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs. In particular we focus on the objects Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f, Gliese 686 b, HR 5183 b, HD 20794 e, and Wolf 1061 d, each of which has been found using the radial velocity method but never imaged (either directly or through transit).

A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $fσ_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $fσ_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\\rm eff}=0.07$.

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts."}

Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination."}

We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D>4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH."}

However, all these methods rely on hard selection cuts, which either contaminate samples when relaxed or exclude genuine members when applied too strictly, leading to uncertain and biased classifications. We develop a flexible and reliable approach to classify disk and halo stars in galaxies by applying fuzzy set theory, which can overcome the limitations of traditional hard-cut selection methods. As a case study, we analyze one of the Milky Way/M31-like galaxies in the TNG50 catalogue. We consider multiple stellar properties as fuzzy variables and characterize their variations between disk and halo stars to construct the respective membership functions. These functions are then combined to assign each star a membership degree corresponding to its galactic component. Our fuzzy set approach provides a more realistic distinction between the disk and the halo stars. This method effectively reduces contamination and recovers genuine members that are often excluded by rigid selection criteria. The fuzzy set theory framework offers a robust alternative to conventional hard-cut methods, enabling more accurate and physically meaningful separation of stellar populations in galaxies."}

The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H_0=73.7\\pm 0.06\\;(\\text{stat.})\\pm 1.1\\;(\\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H_0$ measurements."}

DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20° < $δ$ < 90° and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\\ell$, b) = (168.5°, -60°) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc. Our results show that much of the observed Faraday sky may be dominated by the local magnetic field configuration."}

In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $ζ$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $ζ$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $ζ$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors."}

The simple three-body system (TBS) is the simplest system to test the approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics, and it is easy to implement on a computer. Simulations of the TBS show that the PM approximation and MOND destabilize TBS. In contrast, the MOGA modification of gravity by replacing Newton's inverse square attraction with an inverse attraction for far-away interactions stabilizes the system. The PM approximation and the MOND modification of classical dynamics do not preserve the momentum and angular momentum of a conservative system exactly, and PM does not obey Newton's third law.

Using a probabilistic approach, we identified 770 and 690 high-probability members of NGC 146 and King 14, respectively. Both clusters exhibit well-defined radial density profiles consistent with King models. We estimate the cluster ages as 20 $\\pm$ 5 Myr and 50 $\\pm$ 10 Myr from isochrone fitting, and distances of 2.98 $\\pm$ 0.33 kpc and 2.51 $\\pm$ 0.23 kpc from parallaxes after applying the Bailer-Jones criteria. The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $γ$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member. Overall, the clusters likely formed within the same giant molecular cloud and now exist as an unbound co-moving pair."}

Our strategy builds on a material-independent upper limit on the absorption rate, which we derive from Kramers-Kronig relations applied separately to the longitudinal and transverse dark photon modes.

We then assess the performance of commonly used detector materials in light of these criteria and comment on the prospects of metamaterials featuring tunable plasma frequencies.

Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region.

We show instead that stationary axisymmetric vacuum Einstein equations, when the Ernst potential is written as a $τ$--ratio $\\mathcal{E}=τ_1/τ_0$, admit a universal decomposition of the Ernst numerator into a cubic part containing all second derivatives and a quartic \\emph{gradient envelope}. The cubic sector can be written in terms of $Z_3$--symmetric trilinear Hirota operators, revealing a hidden integrable structure. For $δ=2$, using the explicit Tomimatsu--Sato polynomials, we verify that this trilinear sector coincides with a Yu--Toda--Sasa--Fukuyama (YTSF) equation-type kernel. Thus the TS geometry forms a gravitational realization of a multilinear $τ$--function hierarchy in stationary axisymmetric general relativity."}

This reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity model shows a geometrically motivated dark energy component and naturally recovers General Relativity in the appropriate limit. The free parameters of the model are constrained using the latest DESI BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ exhibits excellent consistency with observational data, with high values of $R^2$ and low values of $χ^2_{\\min}$, AIC, and BIC, confirming the model's strong statistical performance relative to $Λ$CDM. With current $q(0) \\in [-0.40, -0.32]$ and a transition redshift $z_{\\text{tr}} \\sim 0.56$--$0.72$, the dynamical diagnostics show a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase.

The analysis of classical energy conditions shows that the WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied throughout the cosmic evolution, with a violation of the SEC at lower-redshift, which is consistent with late-time acceleration. Linear homogeneous perturbation analysis further confirms the model's dynamical stability. Conclusively, the FHDE-inspired reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity provides a stable, observationally compatible, and geometrically motivated alternative to $Λ$CDM, that successfully describes the late-time cosmic acceleration within the symmetric teleparallel framework."}

These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values."}

However, all these methods rely on hard selection cuts, which either contaminate samples when relaxed or exclude genuine members when applied too strictly, leading to uncertain and biased classifications. We develop a flexible and reliable approach to classify disk and halo stars in galaxies by applying fuzzy set theory, which can overcome the limitations of traditional hard-cut selection methods. As a case study, we analyze one of the Milky Way/M31-like galaxies in the TNG50 catalogue. We consider multiple stellar properties as fuzzy variables and characterize their variations between disk and halo stars to construct the respective membership functions. These functions are then combined to assign each star a membership degree corresponding to its galactic component. Our fuzzy set approach provides a more realistic distinction between the disk and the halo stars. This method effectively reduces contamination and recovers genuine members that are often excluded by rigid selection criteria. The fuzzy set theory framework offers a robust alternative to conventional hard-cut methods, enabling more accurate and physically meaningful separation of stellar populations in galaxies."}

We identify the critical conditions under which the KMNS shadow develops a gap, a unique feature not present in BH shadows. We analyze the properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding a KMNS, within the framework of MOG characterized by the parameter alpha. The study includes a detailed examination of the spacetime geometry and the equations of motion for test particles. In addition, we adopt a simplified model for the disk's radiative flux, temperature distribution, and spectral luminosity.

Currently under the revision process in A&A after positive referee report", "summary": "Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy."}

We propose to remedy this problem by introducing kinetic-mixing terms corresponding to meson-baryon derivative couplings, similar in spirit to the two-mixing-angle scenario of the $η$-$η'$ mixing. This extended parity doublet model contains five parameters in the effective baryonic Lagrangian. Three of them can be determined by using the empirical results for the axial charge of the nucleon together with the masses of the nucleon and its parity partner, the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We discuss various options how to determine the remaining parameters, touching upon the mass of both parity partners if the chiral condensate is put to zero; the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit; and the values of meson-baryon coupling constants related to the decays of the resonance to pion-nucleon and sigma-nucleon."}

Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology."}

To address this, we introduce an updated implementation of the LIGER method, LIGER4GAL, which incorporates all linear-order relativistic RSDs directly at the tracer level of high-resolution N-body simulations. We demonstrate that LIGER4GAL improves upon previous iterations of the LIGER method by reproducing the expected non-linear clustering while maintaining accuracy for relativistic RSDs on large scales. We use the updated code to generate a DESI-like sample of luminous red galaxies from the Huge MultiDark Planck simulation. By measuring the power spectrum multipoles of this sample with and without the imprint of relativistic RSDs, we assess the impact of relativistic effects on measurements of the local PNG signal ($f_\\mathrm{nl}$).

In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $μ$m PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A.

In slow roll inflation, the power spectrum (PS) of PGWs over large scales, which leave the Hubble radius during inflation, is nearly scale-invariant. However, over very small scales, which never leave the Hubble radius, the PS of PGWs behaves as k^2, where k denotes the wave number. We examine the PS of PGWs at such high wave numbers or frequencies when the PGWs are evolved post-inflation, through the epochs of radiation and matter domination. Firstly, we argue that the PS has to be regularized in order to truncate the unphysical k^2 rise at high frequencies. Assuming instantaneous transitions from inflation to the epochs of radiation and matter domination, we carry out the method of adiabatic regularization to arrive at the PS of PGWs over a wide range of frequencies. We show that the process of regularization truncates the k^2 rise and the PS of PGWs oscillates with a fixed amplitude about a vanishing mean value over small scales or, equivalently, at high frequencies. Secondly, we smooth the transition from inflation to radiation domination (to be precise, we smooth the 'effective potential' governing the equation of motion of PGWs) and examine the impact of the smoothing on the regularized PS of PGWs. With the help of a linear smoothing function, we explicitly show that the smoother transition leads to a power-law suppression in the amplitude of the oscillations (about the zero mean value) of the regularized PS of PGWs over small scales that never leave the Hubble radius during inflation. Our analysis indicates that, when transitions are involved, regularization as well as smooth transitions seem essential to ensure that the correlation functions of the PGWs in real space are well behaved. We discuss the directions in which our results need to be extended."}

However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time."}

In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed.

We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D>4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH."}

Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds.

Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence.

The first is distance Malmquist bias (dMB) that affects individual distance estimates and can in principle be approximately corrected. The second is velocity Malmquist bias (vMB) that arises when constructing continuous velocity fields from scattered distance measurements: random scatter places galaxies at noisy spatial positions, introducing spurious velocity gradients that persist even when distances are corrected for dMB. Considering the Tully-Fisher relation as a concrete example, both inverse and forward formulations yield unbiased individual peculiar velocities for galaxies with the same true distance (the forward relation requires a selection-dependent correction), but neither eliminates vMB when galaxies are placed at their inferred distances. We develop a modified Wiener filter that properly encodes correlations between directly observed distance $d$ and true distance $r$ through the conditional probability $P(r|d)$, accounting for the distribution of true distances sampled by galaxies at observed distance $d$. Nonetheless, this modified filter yields suppressed amplitude estimates. Since machine learning autoencoders converge to the Wiener filter for Gaussian fields, they are unlikely to significantly improve velocity field estimation.

The approximations are with ``particle-mesh'' (PM) substitutions of the attractions from objects far away, or one modify the Newtonian accelerations (MOND) or the gravities (MOGA). The PM approximation and MOND modification of classical dynamics break the invariances of classical dynamics. The simple three-body system (TBS) is the simplest system to test the approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics, and it is easy to implement on a computer. Simulations of the TBS show that the PM approximation and MOND destabilize TBS. In contrast, the MOGA modification of gravity by replacing Newton's inverse square attraction with an inverse attraction for far-away interactions stabilizes the system. The PM approximation and the MOND modification of classical dynamics do not preserve the momentum and angular momentum of a conservative system exactly, and PM does not obey Newton's third law. Although the errors and shortcomings of these PM approximations and MOND modifications are small, they cause the instability of the regular dynamics."}

We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $β$, $α$, and the massive parameters ($η_{1}$ and $η_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($α$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($η_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak."}

The first is distance Malmquist bias (dMB) that affects individual distance estimates and can in principle be approximately corrected. The second is velocity Malmquist bias (vMB) that arises when constructing continuous velocity fields from scattered distance measurements: random scatter places galaxies at noisy spatial positions, introducing spurious velocity gradients that persist even when distances are corrected for dMB. Considering the Tully-Fisher relation as a concrete example, both inverse and forward formulations yield unbiased individual peculiar velocities for galaxies with the same true distance (the forward relation requires a selection-dependent correction), but neither eliminates vMB when galaxies are placed at their inferred distances. We develop a modified Wiener filter that properly encodes correlations between directly observed distance $d$ and true distance $r$ through the conditional probability $P(r|d)$, accounting for the distribution of true distances sampled by galaxies at observed distance $d$. Nonetheless, this modified filter yields suppressed amplitude estimates. Since machine learning autoencoders converge to the Wiener filter for Gaussian fields, they are unlikely to significantly improve velocity field estimation. We therefore argue that optimal reconstruction places galaxies at their observed redshifts rather than inferred distances; an approach effective when distance errors exceed $σ_v/H_0$, a condition satisfied for most galaxies in typical surveys beyond the nearby volume."}

Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology."}

We consider a broad class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes and geometrically thin equatorial accretion disk with a prescribed inner radius and infinite outer extent, viewed by a polar observer. Depending on the inner radius of the disk, the thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap. To characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging - the value of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders begin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices corresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii in the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand corner is filled. This matrix, which we call the \"matrix of merging\", is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known, it provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any chosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging exhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric metrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light trajectories. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that certain overlapping patterns are universally forbidden across all such spacetimes and for any inner radius of the disk. Examples for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black holes are provided. The main application of our study is constraining the spacetime metric and the accretion model using observed photon ring overlaps."}

Measurement of the Hubble constant from the doubly lensed quasar HE1104-1805", "comment": "17 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables", "summary": "Time-delay cosmography leverages strongly lensed quasars to measure the Universe's current expansion rate, H_0, independently from other methods. While the latest TDCOSMO results relied mainly on quadruply lensed quasars, doubly lensed systems are far more common and offer precise time delays, potentially enlarging the usable sample by a factor of five and enabling percent-level constraints on H_0. We present the first TDCOSMO analysis of a doubly imaged source, HE1104-1805, including the measurement of the four necessary ingredients. First, by combining 17 years of data from the SMARTS, Euler and WFI telescopes, we measure a time delay of 176.3\\pm 10.8 days. Second, using MUSE data, we extract stellar velocity dispersion measurements in three radial bins with up to 5% precision. Third, employing F160W HST imaging for lens modelling and marginalising over various modelling choices, we measure the Fermat potential difference between the images. Fourth, using wide-field imaging, we measure the convergence added by objects not included in the lens modelling. Hence, we measure the time delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the deflector, favouring a power-law mass model over a baryonic and dark matter composite model. The measurement was performed blindly and yielded H_0 = 64.2^{+5.8}_{-5.0} x $λ_{int} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, where λ_{int} is the internal mass sheet degeneracy parameter. This is in agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 milestone and its precision for λ_{int}=1 is comparable to that obtained with the best-observed quadruply lensed quasars (4-6%). This work is a stepping stone towards a precise measurement of H_0 using a large sample of doubly lensed quasars, supplementing the current sample. The next TDCOSMO milestone paper will include this system in its hierarchical analysis, constraining λ_{int} and H_0 jointly with multiple lenses."}

We calculate the specific moment of inertia and the specific deformation of the gluon matter as, respectively, the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity over a broad range of temperatures and various spatial boundary conditions. We show that the specific deformation, similarly to the moment of inertia, takes negative values in a phenomenologically interesting region of temperatures above the phase transition and turns positive at higher temperatures."}

Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry."}

Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime."}

Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination."}

In this work, we develop a theoretically grounded strategy to identify optimal detector materials for solar dark photon absorption. Our strategy builds on a material-independent upper limit on the absorption rate, which we derive from Kramers-Kronig relations applied separately to the longitudinal and transverse dark photon modes. We show how the optimal material properties depend on the dark photon mass relative to the detector's plasma frequency, identifying the conditions under which a detector can saturate the theoretical upper limit. We then assess the performance of commonly used detector materials in light of these criteria and comment on the prospects of metamaterials featuring tunable plasma frequencies. Our results provide a general and model-independent framework to effectively guide the design of next-generation experiments targeting solar dark photons."}
