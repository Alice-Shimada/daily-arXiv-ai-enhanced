Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online\narchitecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and\nblack hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are\ngenerated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter\nspace. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in\nsystematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on\nradiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i)\nthe intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation\nof the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to\nthe online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze\ninterpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation\nschemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \\geq\n0.9$, we find that $\\ell_{\\text{max}} \\geq 30$ is required for the necessary\naccuracy.

Cloud-crushing timescales are computed and\ncompared to radiative cooling timescales, including both gas-phase cooling and\ndust-induced cooling, for a large grid of clump densities, dust-to-gas mass\nratios, and shock velocities. When the dust-to-gas mass ratio exceeds\n$10^{-3}$, gas-grain collisions become efficient enough that the cooling\ntimescale $t_{\\rm cool}$ falls below the cloud-crushing timescale $t_{\\rm cc}$\nover a broad span of clump densities and shock velocities, enabling dusty\nclumps to survive even fast reverse shocks.

Our analysis\nyields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in\nthe ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground\ngalaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is\n$B_{\\rm host}^{\\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\\mu{\\rm G}$. Additionally, we\nplace upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\\rm\nhost}^{\\rm halo} < 4.81\\mu{\\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos,\n$B_{\\rm f/g}^{\\rm halo} < 4.31\\mu{\\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average\nfraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \\lesssim \\log_{10} \\left( M_{\\rm halo} /\nM_{\\odot}\\right) \\lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We\nfind that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with\nprevious measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs\nand have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or\nFRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of\nRM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples."}

Through the void galaxy cross correlation function,\ncosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for\nrefined deductions of the Universe's content by correcting apparent geometric\ndistortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the\nAlcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological\nreconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically\nusing the Zel'dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies\nfrom their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by\npeculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure\nthe void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space.\nThis approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small\nnonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the\nstatistical power of void studies and significantly improving their\ncosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even\nat small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple\nenvironment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales\nsignificantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 %\nimprovement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous\nmethods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to\na better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters.

We show that in $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory, where finite action configurations are monopole loops, small loops at\nlarge separations also interact with the same type of $1/r^4$ interaction. If\none ignores the classical interactions between monopoles, following the same\nidea as in Yang-Mills theory, the one-monopole partition function is also\ninfrared divergent at strong coupling. However, $1/r^4$ interactions among\nsmall loops should be viewed as a consequence of multipole expansion, and\nemanate from $1/r^2$ interaction between current segments.

The SP model is widely accepted in material physics to explain\namorphous thermal properties and is an extension of the two-level systems (TLS)\nmodel, which has been applied in interstellar amorphous dust physics. In the SP\nmodel, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a\ndouble-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric\ninteraction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of\nthe amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical\nsolutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these\nresults, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential\nbarrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed\nspectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the\nconventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain\nvarious long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening\nin the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to\nthe TLS model. Further comparison and verification with observational data and\nlaboratory measurements are necessary to refine the model."}

The superMIGHTEE project\ncombines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep\nimages at several $\\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5\nGHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the\ninitial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum\nimages covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in\nthe XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source\ncatalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The\nredshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\\sim4$ with a median value of\n$z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with\nthe MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral\nproperties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated\npopulation to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities\nof a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population\nexhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy\ninjection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten\nsignificantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with\npeaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release.\nSubsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image\ncubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE\nultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of\nactive galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged)."}

The deconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory has a\nproduct $U(1)^N$ gauge group, which breaks down to the diagonal\n$U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. A linear superposition of the Dirac\nmonopoles each from each $U(1)$ gauge group placed on top of each other in the\n3D space constitutes a Dirac monopole with a unit magnetic charge under the\nunbroken $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. However, the Dirac monopole in\neach $U(1)$ gauge group has a fractional magnetic charge of the unbroken\n$U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group with the same sign, which makes these\n``constituent'' Dirac monopoles repel each other. Therefore, for the\n``composite'' Dirac monopole of the $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group to be\nstable, there must be attractive forces that counter the repulsive magnetic\nCoulomb forces. I argue that such attractive forces are provided by the\nNielsen-Olesen type magnetic flux tubes of unbroken gauge groups. This internal\nstructure of the composite Dirac monopole of $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group\nresembles the composite magnetic monopole found in the model constructed by\nSaraswat arXiv:1608.06951.

These sources, dubbed\n``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the\nliterature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive\nblack holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has\nsignificant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of\nthe difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive\ntheir rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide\nsignatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that\nuniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we\nreport the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the\nexistence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the\nfirst 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a\npossible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant\nBalmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the\nabsorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer\nedge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the\ncenter of the system.
